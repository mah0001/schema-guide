# The challenge of finding and assessing, accessing, and using data {#chapter01}

In the landscape of data sharing policies adopted by numerous national and international organizations, a common challenge emerges for researchers and other data users: the practicality of finding, accessing, and using data in an efficient manner. Navigating through a vast and ever-growing pool of data sources and types can be a complex, time-consuming, and sometimes frustrating endeavor. It involves identifying pertinent sources, acquiring and comprehending relevant datasets, and efficiently analyzing them. This challenge is marked by issues such as inadequate metadata, limitations of data discovery systems, and low visibility of valuable data repositories and cataloguing systems. The technical hurdles to data discoverability, accessibility, and usability must be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of data sharing policies and maximize the utility of collected data. In the upcoming sections, we will delve into these challenges.

## Finding and assessing data

Researchers and data users identify and acquire data in various ways. Some rely on personal networks --or "tribal knowledge"-- to find and obtain the data they need. This can lead to the use of "convenient" data that may not be the most relevant. Others may locate datasets of interest in academic publications, which can be challenging as datasets are often not cited in a consistent or standardized manner. But most data users search specialized data catalogs or use general search engines to locate relevant data resources or catalogs.

The lead internet search engines have remarkable capabilities in locating and ranking relevant resources available online. The algorithms that power these search engines have lexical and semantic capabilities. Simple data queries -- for example a query for "population of India in 2023" will receive an instant informative response (although not always from the most authoritative source of information). Less straightforward queries -- for example, "indicators of malnutrition in yemen") will also return adequate responses, as the engine will be able to associate malnutrition with the anthropometric indicators of stunting, wasting, and underweight population. But these search engines are not optimized and may not be able to find the most relevant data when the user's requirements cannot be expressed in the form of a straightforward query. For example, internet search engines would be of limited help to a researcher looking for "satellite imagery that could be combined with survey data to generate small-area estimates of child malnutrition". 

While general search engines are crucial in directing users to relevant catalogs and repositories, specialized online data catalogs and platforms maintained by national or international organizations, academic data centers, data archives, or data libraries may thus be better suited for researchers seeking relevant data. However, the search algorithms integrated into such specialized data catalogs can sometimes provide unsatisfactory search results due to the lack of optimization of search indexes and algorithms. With the fast developments of AI-based solutions, many of them available as open source software, specialized catalogs have the possibility to considerably improve the capabilities of their search engine, transforming them into proper data recommender systems.

The solution to improve discoverability of data involves (i) improving the on-line visibility of specialized data catalogs, and (ii) modernizing the discoverability tools in specialized data catalogs.[1] Both require high quality, comprehensive and structured metadata. Metadata -- the detailed description of datasets -- is what search engines will index and use to identify and locate data of interest

Metadata is the first thing that data users will look at to assess whether the data meet their needs. Ideally, researchers should have easy access to both relevant datasets and the metadata required to evaluate the data's suitability for their specific purposes. Obtaining a dataset may be time-consuming and sometimes costly. Therefore, users should only invest resources and time in acquiring data that they know is of high quality and relevance.

Assessing a dataset's fitness for a specific purpose necessitates different metadata elements for varying data types and uses. Some metadata elements are straightforward, such as data type, temporal coverage, geographic coverage, scope and universe, and access policy. However, more detailed information may be required. For instance, a survey dataset (microdata) may only be relevant to a researcher if a specific modality of a specific variable has a sufficient number of respondents. If the sample size is minimal, the dataset would not allow for any valid statistical inference. Furthermore, comparability across sources is crucial to many users and uses, so the metadata should provide a detailed description of sampling, universe, variables, concepts, and methods relevant to the data type. A data user may also require information on the frequency of data updates (for time series or panel surveys, for example) and on previous uses of the dataset by the research community.

## Accessing data

Accessing data is a multifaceted challenge that involves legal, ethical, and practical considerations. To ensure that data access is legal, ethical and enables relevant and responsible use of the data, data providers and users must adhere to certain principles and practices:

- Data providers must ensure that they have the legal rights to share the data and that they define clear usage rights for data users. Data users need to know how they can use the data, whether it's for research, commercial purposes, or other applications, and they must strictly comply with the terms of use.
- Data access must comply with data privacy laws and ethical standards. Sensitive or personally identifiable information must be handled with care to protect individuals' privacy.
- Data providers must offer comprehensive metadata that provides context and full understanding of the data. Metadata should include details about the data's provenance, including its history, transformations, and processing steps. Understanding how the data was created and modified is essential for accurate and responsible analysis. 
- Data should be available in formats that are user-friendly and compatible with common data analysis tools. Common formats like CSV, JSON, or Excel can be practical choices. 
- Data should be made accessible through various means, considering users' preferences and capacities. This might involve offering downloadable files, providing access through web-based tools, and supporting data streaming. APIs are crucial for enabling programmable access to data. They allow researchers to retrieve and manipulate data programmatically, integrating it into their research workflows and applications.

Data users in developing countries often face additional challenges in accessing data. These challenges include:
   - Lack of resources: Researchers in developing countries may not have the financial resources to purchase data or to access data that is stored in expensive cloud-based repositories.
   - Lack of infrastructure: Researchers in developing countries may not have access to the high-speed internet and computing resources that are needed to work with large datasets.
   - Lack of expertise: Researchers in developing countries may not have the expertise to work with complex data formats and to use data analysis tools.
These specific challenges should be taken into consideration when developming data dissemination systems.

## Using data

The challenge for data users is not only to discover data, but also to obtain all necessary information to fully understand the data and to use them responsibly and appropriately. A same indicator label, for example *unemployment rate (%)*, can mask significant differences by country, source, and time. The international recommendations for the definition and calculation of *unemployment rate* has changed over time, and not all countries use the same data collection instrument (labor force survey or other) to collect the underlying data. In on-line data dissemination platforms, detailed metadata should therefore always be associated and disseminated with the data. This must be a close association; the relevant metadata will ideally not be more than one click away from the data. This is particularly critical when a platform publishes data from multiple sources that are not fully harmonized.

The scope and meaning of labour statistics in general are determined by their source and methodology, and this is certainly true for the unemployment rate. In order to interpret the data accurately, it is crucial to understand what the data convey and how they were collected and constructed, which implies having information on the relevant metadata. The design and characteristics of the data source (typically a labour force survey or similar household survey for the unemployment rate), especially in terms of definitions and concepts used, geographical and age coverage, and reference periods have great implications for the resulting data, making it crucial to take them into account when analysing the statistics. It is also essential to seek information on any methodological changes and breaks in series to assess their impact for trend analysis, and to keep in mind methodological differences across countries when conducting cross-country studies.

When possible, reproducible or replicable scripts that made use of the data, and the analytical output of these scripts, should be published with the data. These scripts may be highly valuable to researchers who may want to expand the scope of previous data analysis or re-purpose part of the code, and to students who may learn from reading and replicating the work of experienced analysts. To foster the usability of data, we developed a specific metadata schema for the documentation of research projects and scripts.  

## A FAIR solution

To effectively address the information retrieval challenge, researchers should consider not only the content of the information but also the context within which it is created and the diverse range of potential users who may need it. A foundational element is being mindful of users and their potential interactions with the data and work. To improve search capabilities and increase the visibility of specialized data libraries, a combination of better data curation, search engines, and increased accessibility is necessary. Adhering to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is an effective approach to data management. (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008469)

It is essential to focus on the entire data curation process, from acquisition to dissemination, to optimize data analysis by streamlining the process of finding, assessing, accessing, and preparing data. This requires anticipating user needs and investing in the curation of data for reuse. To ensure data is **findable**, libraries should implement advanced search algorithms and filters, including full-text, advanced, semantic, and recommendation-based search options. Search engine optimization is also crucial for making catalogs more **accessible**. Additionally, multiple modes of data access should be available to improve accessibility, while data should be made **interoperable** to promote data sharing and reusability. Detailed metadata, including fitness for purpose assessments, should be displayed, alongside scripts and permanent availability options, such as a DOI, to promote **reuse**.
