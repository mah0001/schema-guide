# Introduction {-}

The volume and diversity of socio-economic data available to researchers, analysts, and decision makers have increased considerably over the past decade. The demand for data is also growing and diversifying. This brings opportunities to increase the use and thus the social and economic value of existing data. "Data that were initially collected with one intention can be reused for a completely different purpose. (…) Because the potential of data to serve a productive use is essentially limitless, enabling the reuse and repurposing of data is critical if data are to lead to better lives.” ([World Bank, World Development Report 2021](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2021)) 

But data often remain difficult to find, access, and use. Data analysts devote a disproportionate share of their time to finding and wrangling data, and overly rely on tribal knowledge to identify dataset that best fit their needs. Many valuable datasets remain under-exploited.

Data libraries and repositories play a critical role in fostering the responsible dissemination and use of data. By developing and maintaining inter-operable, openly-accessible online catalogs of well-curated data, they contribute to the discoverability, visibility, and usability of data. To guarantee *discoverability* and *visibility*, these catalogs must be powered by advanced search algorithms, able to operate as recommender systems, and be search engine optimized. And to foster the *usability* of data, they must provide users with detailed documentation of the data, and package and share the data in the most convenient formats. 

**Achieving these objectives requires comprehensive and structured metadata**. The adoption of metadata standards and schemas[^1] is an effective and efficient solution to foster the comprehensiveness and quality of metadata, and the inter-operability of data catalogs that makes use of them. These standards and schemas must be specific to the type of data being documented. This Guide describes a set of recommended standards and schemas and provides the justification and guidelines for their implementation. Chapter 1 describes the challenge of finding and using data. Chapter 2 describes the expected features of a modern data catalog. Chapter 3 explains how rich and structured metadata enable advanced search algorithms and recommender systems optimized for data discoverability. Chapters 4 to 13 present the specific standards and schemas we recommend for different data types, with examples of their use.

We adopt a broad definition of data in this document is broad, although we focus on data types used in social sciences. This scope may be extended in future versions of the Guide. The distinction we make between data types matters to identify the most appropriate metadata standards and tools to be used for their documentation. The data types we cover are: 

- Structured (quantitative) data:
  - **Microdata**: the unit-level data on a population of individuals, households, dwellings, facilities, establishments, or other. Microdata can be generated from surveys, censuses, administrative recording systems, or sensors.
  - **Statistical tables**: aggregated statistical information provided in the form of cross-tables, e.g., as published in statistics yearbooks or census reports. Statistical tables are often derived from microdata.
  - **Indicators and time series**: Indicators are summary measures derived from observed facts (often from microdata). When repeated over time at a regular frequency, the indicators form a time series.
   - **Geographic datasets and data services**: Geographic (or geospatial) data identify and depict geographic locations, boundaries, and characteristics of the surface of the earth. They can be provided in the form of datasets (raster or vector data) or data services (web applications).
  
- Unstructured data: 
  - **Text**: A collection of documents (bibliographic resources of any type, such as books, papers, reports, manuals, and other resources consisting of text) form a corpus. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, corpora can be converted into structured information. Textual information extracted from social media (such as Tweets or news) can also be submitted to NLP models to extract quantitative data (e.g., by applying classification techniques). 
  - **Images**: Digital images can be processed using machine learning algorithms (of object detection, classification, or other).  
  - **Audio and video recordings**: Speech-to-text algorithms can transform audio and video recordings as text files. They can thus be considered as data in the same way we consider text as data. 
  - **Programs and scripts**: Although they are not data per se, we treat programs and scripts used to edit, transform, tabulate, analyze, model, and visualize data as data-related resources that need to be documented, catalogued, and disseminated in pursuit of transparency and reproducibility of data use.

This Guide is intended to be a live document. The standards and schemas it describes, and the related tools, may be updated and upgraded periodically. The Guide is therefore published as an open document available on GitHub.

[^1]: We refer to metadata *standards* when a community or organization is in charge of the development and maintenance of a metadata schema, with formal governance. We use the term metadata *schema* when no formal governance is established.
