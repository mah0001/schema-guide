# Introduction {-}

Over the last decade, the supply of socio-economic data available to researchers has increased considerably, along with advances in the tools and methods available to exploit these data. This provides unprecedented opportunities to increase the use and value of existing data. "Data that were initially collected with one intention can be reused for a completely different purpose. (…) Because the potential of data to serve a productive use is essentially limitless, enabling the reuse and repurposing of data is critical if data are to lead to better lives.” ([World Bank, World Development Report 2021](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2021)) 

However, data can be challenging to find, access, and use, resulting in many valuable datasets remaining underutilized. Data libraries and repositories play a crucial role in making data more discoverable, visible, and usable, but many are built on sub-optimal standards and technological solutions, resulting in limited findability and visibility of their assets. To address these market failures, a market place for data is needed. This market place can be developed on the model of e-commerce platforms, designed to serve both custommers and suppliers. Data platforms must be optimized to provide users with convenient ways of identifying, locating, and acquiring data that fit their purposes and preferences, and to provide data producers with a trustable mechanism to share their datasets in a cost-effective, safe, and responsible manner. To achieve this, comprehensive and structured metadata that describe the "products" is required. Indeed, search algorithms and recommender systems exploit metadata, not data. Metadata are essential to the credibility, discoverability, visibility, and usability of the data. Adopting metadata standards and schemas[^1] is a practical and efficient solution to promote the completeness and quality of the metadata. This Guide presents a set of recommended standards and schemas covering multiple types of data, both structured and unstructured, along with guidance and justification for their implementation. The data types covered include microdata, statistical tables, indicators and time series, geographic datasets, text, images, video recordings, and programs and scripts.

Chapter 1 of the guide outlines the challenges associated with finding and using data. Chapter 2 describes the essential features of a modern data catalog, and Chapter 3 explains how rich and structured metadata, compliant with the metadata standards and schemas we describe, can enable advanced search algorithms and recommender systems optimized for data discoverability. Finally, Chapters 4 to 13 present specific standards and schemas we recommend for various data types, along with examples of their use.


[^1]: We refer to metadata *standards* when a community or organization is in charge of the development and maintenance of a metadata schema, with formal governance. We use the term metadata *schema* when no formal governance is established.
