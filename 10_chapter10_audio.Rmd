The schema we propose to document audio recordings is a combination of elements from the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](https://dublincore.org/) and from the [AudioObject (from schema.org)](https://schema.org/AudioObject) schemas. 

The Dublin Core is a generic and versatile standard, which we use (in an augmented form) for the documentation of Documents (Chapter 4), Images (Chapter 9), and Videos (chapter 11). It contains 15 core elements, to which we added a selection of elements from VideoObject. We also included the elements `keywords`, `topics`, `tags`, `provenance` and `additional` that are found in other schemas documented in the Guide.   

This schema is not intended to document and publish metadata specific to recordings of music. For that purpose, a specialized standard like the [MEAD (Media Enrichment and Description)](https://kb.ddex.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=13470928) is more suitable. The schema we propose is intended to be used for archiving and cataloguing any type of audio file, such as recording of interviews, jingles, radio announcements, and others. The schema is kept simple, but it contains the elements needed to document the resources and their content in a way that will foster their discoverability in data catalogs. Compliance with AudioObject elements contributes to search engine optimization, as search engines like Google, Bing and others "reward" metadata published in formats compatible with the schema.org recommendations.

When published in a NADA catalog, the metadata will appear in a specific tab.  @@@ Add Audio" to NADA tabs

## Augmenting audio metadata

Audio recordings typically come with limited metadata. To make them more discoverable, a transcription of the recording can be generated, stored, and indexed in the catalog. This will significantly increase the discoverability of the resource, and offer the possibility to apply semantic searchability on audio metadata. Machine learning solutions are available to automatically generate transcriptions at a very low cost. Tools like [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/), [Google Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text?hl=en), or [Microsoft Azure's Speech to Text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/#overview) can reliably convert spoken audio (from audio or video files) to text. The metadata schema we propose includes an element `transcription` that can store transcriptions (and possibly their automatically-generated translations) in the audio recording metadata. Word embedding models and topic models can be applied to the transcriptions to further augment the metadata. 

  
## Schema description 
  
The first three elements of the schema (`repositoryid`, `published`, and `overwrite`) are not part of the audio metadata. They are parameters used to indicate how the audio recording metadata will be published in a NADA catalog. 

   - **`repositoryid`** identifies the collection in which the metadata will be published. By default, the metadata will be published in the central catalog. To publish them in a collection, the collection must have been previously created in NADA. 

   - **`published`**: Indicates whether the metadata must be made visible to visitors of the catalog. By default, the value is 0 (unpublished). This value must be set to 1 (published) to make the metadata visible.

   - **`overwrite`**: Indicates whether metadata that may have been previously uploaded for the same audio recording can be overwritten. By default, the value is "no". It must be set to "yes" to overwrite existing information. Note that an audio recording will be considered as being the same as a previously uploaded one if the identifier provided in the metadata element `audio_description > idno` is the same.

**`metadata_information`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable]*
The metadata information set is used to document the video <u>metadata</u> (not the audio file itself). This provides information useful for archiving purposes. This block is optional. It is recommended however to enter at least the identification and affiliation of the metadata producer, and the date of creation of the metadata. One reason for this is that metadata can be shared and harvested across catalogs/organizations, so metadata produced by one organization can be found in other data centers. 
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_01.JPG){width=100%}
  <br>
  - **`title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The title of the audio recording.<br>
  - **`idno`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br> 
  A unique identifier for the metadata document (unique in the catalog; ideally also unique globally). This is different from the audio file unique ID (see `idno` element in section *audio_description* below), although it is good practice to generate IDs that would maintain an easy connection between the metadata IDNO and the audio IDNO.<br>   
  - **`producers`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
  This refers to the producer(s) of the metadata, NOT to the producer(s) of the audio recording. This could for example be the data curator in a data center.<br>
     - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
     Name of the metadata producer/curator. An alternative to entering the name of the curator (e.g. for privacy protection purpose) is to enter the curator ID (see the element *abbr* below)<br>
     - **`abbr`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
     Can be used to provide an ID of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
     - **`affiliation`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
     Affiliation of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
     - **`role`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
     Specific role of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
   - **`production_date`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   Date the metadata (not the table) was produced.<br>
   - **`version`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   Version of the metadata (not version of the table).<br>

**`audio_description`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable]* <br>
The `audio_description` section contains all elements that will be used to describe the audio recording and its content. These are the elements that will be indexed and made searchable in data catalogs.

- **`idno`** *[Mandatory, Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_02.JPG){width=100%}
  <br>
  `idno` is a unique identification number that is used to uniquely identify an audio recording. Such a unique identifier will be required by any data catalog. It will also help users of the data cite the audio file properly. The best option is to obtain a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/) for the recording, as it will ensure that the ID is unique globally. Alternatively, it can be an ID constructed by an organization using a consistent scheme. Note that the schema allows you to provide more than one ID for an audio recording (see the `other_ids` field described below). This element maps to the "identifier" element in the Dublin Core. 

- **`identifiers`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_03.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   This element is used to enter video identifiers other than the `idno` element described above). It can for example be a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Note that the identifier entered in `idno` can be repeated here, allowing to attach a "type" attribute to it.
      - **`type`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The type of unique identifier, e.g., "DOI".
      - **`value`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The identifier. <br><br>
  
  - **`title`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_04.JPG){width=100%}
<br>
  The title of the audio recording. This element maps to the element *caption* in AudioObject. 

- **`alt_title`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_05.JPG){width=100%}
<br>
  An alias for the audio recording title. This element maps to the element *alternateName* in AudioObject.

- **`description`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_06.JPG){width=100%}
<br>
  A summary of the audio recording, usually about a paragraph long (around 150 to 250 words). This element maps to the element *abstract* in AudioObject.

- **`genre`** *[Optional ; Repeatable ; String]* <br>
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_07.JPG){width=100%}
<br>
  Genre of the audio recording, broadcast channel or group. This is a AudioObject element. A controlled vocabulary can be used.

- **`keywords`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_08.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   A list of keywords that provide information on the core content of the audio recording. Keywords provide a convenient solution to improve the discoverability of the audio recording, as it allows terms and phrases not found elsewhere in the audio recording metadata to be indexed and to make the audio recording discoverable by text-based search engines. A controlled vocabulary will preferably be used (although not required), such as the [UNESCO Thesaurus](http://vocabularies.unesco.org/browser/thesaurus/en/). The list can combine keywords from multiple controlled vocabularies, and user-defined keywords.  
      - **`name`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The keyword itself.
      - **`vocabulary`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The controlled vocabulary (including version number or date) from which the keyword is extracted, if any.
      - **`uri`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The URL of the controlled vocabulary from which the keyword is extracted, if any.<br><br>

      This element is used to define one or multiple bounding box(es), which are the (rectangular) fundamental geometric description of the geographic coverage of the audio recording. A bounding box is defined by west and east longitudes and north and south latitudes, and includes the largest geographic extent of the audio's geographic coverage. The bounding box provides the geographic coordinates of the top left (north/west) and bottom-right (south/east) corners of a rectangular area. This element can be used in catalogs as the first pass of a coordinate-based search.

   ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_38.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   The duration of the audio recording in ISO 8601 date format. This element is a AudioObject element.

   ISO 8601 durations are expressed using the following format, where (n) is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that <u>follows</u> the (n). For example: (3)H means 3 hours. 

   **`P(n)Y(n)M(n)DT(n)H(n)M(n)S`**

    Where:
    
       - P is the **Period designator** and is always placed at the beginning of the duration
         - (n)Y represents the number of years
         - (n)M represents the number of months
         - (n)W represents the number of weeks
         - (n)D represents the number of days
       - T is the **Time designator** and always precedes the time components
         - (n)H represents the number of hours
         - (n)M represents the number of minutes
         - (n)S represents the number of seconds

   For example, **P1Y2M20DT3H30M8S** represents a duration of one year, two months, twenty days, three hours, thirty minutes, and eight seconds.

   Date and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower-order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, "P23DT23H" and "P4Y" are both acceptable duration representations.

   - **`rights`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_39.JPG){width=100%}

   - **`transcript`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>   
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_44.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>

      - **`language`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>   
      The language of the transcript.
      - **`text`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>

   - **`album`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>   
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_45.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   When an audio recording is published in a catalog containing many other audio recording, it may be desirable to organize them by album. Albums are collections of audio recording organized by theme, period, location, author, or other criteria. One audio recording can belong to more than one album. Albums are "virtual collections". 
      - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The name (label) of the album. 
      - **`description`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      A brief description of the album.
      - **`owner`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The owner of the album.
      - **`uri`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>

   - **`provenance`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_46.JPG){width=100%}  
   <br>
   Metadata can be programmatically harvested from external catalogs. The `provenance` group of elements is used to store information on the provenance of harvested metadata, and on alterations that may have been done to the harvested metadata. These elements are NOT part of the IPTC or DCMI metadata standard.<br>
     - **`origin_description`** *[Required ; Not repeatable]* <br>
     The `origin_description` elements are used to describe when and from where metadata have been extracted or harvested.<br>  
        - **`harvest_date`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The date and time the metadata were harvested, in ISO 8601 format.<br>
        - **`altered`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; Boolean]* <br>
        A boolean variable ("true" or "false"; "true by default) indicating whether the harvested metadata have been modified before being re-published. In many cases, the unique identifier of the study (element `idno` in the Study Description / Title Statement section) will be modified when published in a new catalog.<br>
        - **`base_url`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The URL from where the metadata were harvested.<br>
        - **`identifier`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The unique dataset identifier (`idno` element) in the source catalog. When harvested metadata are re-published in a new catalog, the identifier will likely be changed. The `identifier` element in `provenance` is used to maintain traceability.<br>
        - **`date_stamp`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The datestamp (in UTC date format) of the metadata record in the originating repository (this should correspond to the date the metadata were last updated in the source catalog).<br>
        - **`metadata_namespace`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        @@@@@@@ <br>

   - **`tags`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>        
     As shown in section 1.7 of the Guide, tags, when associated with `tag_groups`, provide a powerful and flexible solution to enable custom facets (filters) in data catalogs. See section 1.7 for an example in R.
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_audio_47.JPG){width=100%}  
  <br>
    - **`tag`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
    A user-defined tag.
    - **`tag_group`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br><br>
    A user-defined group (optional) to which the tag belongs. Grouping tags allows implementation of controlled facets in data catalogs.

   - **`additional`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable]*<br>
   The `additional` element allows data curators to add their own metadata elements to the schema. All custom elements must be added within the `additional` block; embedding them elsewhere in the schema would cause schema validation to fail.
