## The JSON and XML formats 

Metadata standards and schemas consist of structured lists of metadata fields. They serve multiple purposes. First, they help data curators generate complete and usable documentation of their datasets. Metadata standards that are intuitive and *human-readable* better serve this purpose. Second, standards and schemas help generate machine-readable metadata to be used as input to software and database applications like data catalogs. Metadata available in open file formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtended Markup Language) are most suitable for this purposes.

Some international metadata standards like the Data Documentation Initative (DDI Codebook, for microdata), the Dublin Core (a generic metadata specification, which we use to document documents), or the ISO 19139 (for geospatial data) are defined and published as XML specifications. XML schemas can be translated into JSON schemas, which is our preferred format (a choice we justify in the next section). The standards and schemas that we cover in this Guide are presented in their JSON version.  

The JSON format is open, non-propriertary. JSON files are language-independent plain text files. Metadata in JSON files are stored as *key/value* pairs where the keys are the metadata element names. For example, the name of a *key* can be "title", and the value attached to it could be "Labor Force Survey 2020". Values can be string, numeric, boolean, arrays, null, or JSON objects (for a more detailed description of the JSON format, see [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)). 

The example below shows how this format would be used in a metadata schema to document the list of authors of a document, using elements from the Dublin Core metadata standard.   

<center>
![](./images/document_example_01_authors_keywords.JPG){width=100%}
</center>
<br>

In the *documents* schema, authors are documented in the metadata element `authors` which contains the following sub-elements: `first_name`, `initial`, `last_name`, and `affiliation`.

<center>
![](./images/JSON_array_list_authors.JPG){width=100%}
</center>

In JSON, this information will be stored as follows. 

```{json}
"authors":[
  { "first_name":"Bo", "initial":"P.J", "last_name":"Andrée", "affiliation":"World Bank"},
  { "first_name":"Andres", "last_name":"Chamorro", "affiliation":"World Bank"},
  { "first_name":"Aart",   "last_name":"Kraay",    "affiliation":"World Bank"},
  { "first_name":"Phoebe", "last_name":"Spencer",  "affiliation":"World Bank"},
  { "first_name":"Dieter", "last_name":"Wang",     "affiliation":"World Bank"},
]
```

The same information stored in XML format is as follows: 

```{xml}
<authors>
  <author>
    <first_name>Bo</first_name> 
    <initial>P.J.</initial> 
    <last_name>Andrée</last_name> 
    <affiliation>World Bank</affiliation>
  </author>
  <author>
    <first_name>Andres</first_name> 
    <last_name>Chamorro</last_name> 
    <affiliation>World Bank</affiliation>
  </author>
    <author>
    <first_name>Aart</first_name> 
    <last_name>Kraay</last_name> 
    <affiliation>World Bank</affiliation>
  </author>
    <author>
    <first_name>Phoebe</first_name> 
    <last_name>Spencer</last_name> 
    <affiliation>World Bank</affiliation>
  </author>
  <author>
    <first_name>Dieter</first_name> 
    <last_name>Wang</last_name> 
    <affiliation>World Bank</affiliation>
  </author>
</authors>
```

JSON and XML formats have similarities: 

   - Both are human readable and saved as text files (non-proprietary format)
   - Both are hierarchical (they contain values within values)
   - Both can be parsed and used by many programming languages including R and Python

JSON files are easier than XML to parse and to generate programatically (we will show in this Guide how JSON metadata schemas correspond to lists in R and to dictionaries in Python), and easier to read by humans. This makes them our preferred choice.

## Where to find the schemas' documentation

The most recent documentation of the schemas we present in the Guide, and of the corresponding API, is available on-line at https://ihsn.github.io/nada-api-redoc/catalog-admin/#.

The metadata schemas have a hierarchical structure. They all start with three or four common elements that are not strictly-speaking part of the metadata, but that contain information that will be used by the NADA cataloguing application:

<center>
![](./images/reDoc_0.JPG){width=100%}
</center>
<br>

   - **`repositoryid`** identifies the collection in which the metadata will be published 
   - **`access_policy`** determines if and how the <u>data files</u> will be accessible from the catalog in which the metadata are published. This element only applies to the microdata and geographic schemas. It makes use of a controlled vocabulary with the following access policy options: 
      - **`direct`**: data can be downloaded without requiring them to be registered; 
      - **`open`**: same as "direct", with an open data license attached to the dataset; 
      - **`public`**: public use files, which only require users to be registered in the catalog;
      - **`licensed`**: access to data is restricted to registered users who receive authorization to use the data, after submitting a request;
      - **`remote`**: data are made available by an external data repository;
      - **`data_na`**: data are not accessible to the public (only metadata are published). 
   - **`published`** determines the status of the metadata in the on-line catalog (with options 0 = draft and 1 = published). Published entries are visible to all visitors of the on-line catalog; unpublished (draft) entries will only be visible by the catalog administrators and reviewers. 
   - **`overwrite`** determines whether the metadata already in the catalog for this entry can be overwritten (iwith options yes or no, 'no' being the default)  

The various sections that follow this set of cataloguing elements will be specific to each standard/schema. For example, the DDI standard used to document microdata contains the following main sections:
   
   - **`document description`**: a description of the metadata (who documented the dataset, when, etc.) Most schemas will contain such a section describing the metadata, useful mainly to data curators and catalog administrators. In other schemas, this section may be named `metadata_description`. 
   - **`study description`**: the description of the survey/census/study, not including the data files and data dictionary.
   - **`file description`**: a list and description of data files associated to the study.
   - **`variable description`**: the data dictionary (description of variables).

The schema-specific sections are followed by a few other metadata elements that are common to most schemas. These are elements that will provide useful information for cataloguing and discoverability purposes. They include **tags** (which allow catalog administrators to attach tags to datasets independently of their type, which can be used as filters in the catalog), and external resources. Some schemas also provide the possibility for data curators to add their own metadata elements, to accommodate information for which no metadata element is provided in the schema (the use of these `additional` elements should be the exception, as metadata schemas are designed to cover the full scope of metadata).  

In the schemas, metadata fields/elements can have the following properties:

   - **Optional** or **required**. When an element is declared as *required* (or *mandatory*), the metadata will be considered invalid if it contains no information in that element. To keep the schemas flexible, very few elements are set as required. Note that it is possible for a metadata element to be `required` but have all its components (for elements that have sub-elements) declared as optional. This will be the case when at least one (but any) of the sub-element must contain information. It is also possible for an element to be declared *optional* but have one or more of its sub-elements declared `mandatory` (this means that the field is optional, but if it is used, some of its features MUST be provided.) 
   - **Repeatable** or **Not repeatable**. For example, the element `nation` in the DDI standard is *Repeatable* because a dataset can cover more than one country, while the element `title` is *Not repeatable* because a study should be identified by a unique title. 
   - **Type**. This indicates the format of the information contained in an element. It can be a *string* (text), a *numeric* value, a *boolean* variable (TRUE/FALSE), or an *array*.

The schemas can also provide default values and controlled vocabularies for some elements.

## Translating a JSON schema into R and Python 

Most elements in metadata standards and schemas are optional. Schema-compliant metadata can thus be very brief and simple. But the objective of data curators should always be to generate and publish as much and as detailed metadata as possible. This means that metadata documents can be long and relatively complex. This will for example be the case of metadata compliant with the DDI metadata standard used to document microdata, which contains elements that describe each variable in a dataset with elements that include (optional) summary statistics. As a dataset can contain thousands of variables, the production of such metadata requires the use of a specialized metadata editor (the metadata editor would read the data files and generate a DDI-compliant list of variables with their name, label, summary statistics). When the metadata are not too complex, they can be generated using languages like R and Python. For example, the documentation of publications or images will typically only require a few simple metadata elements (author, title, date, etc.) Generating metadata using programming languages has significant advantages. It allows automation, and makes the documentation process fully replicable and transparent. 

Metadata compliant with all schemas presented in this Guide can in principle be generated using programming languages. We show below how these schemas, as described in their [on-line documentation](https://ihsn.github.io/nada-api-redoc/catalog-admin/#), translate into R and Python scripts. Generating metadata using R will consist of producing a *list* object (itself containing lists), while generating metadata using Python will consist of producing a *dictionary* object (itself containing lists and dictionaries). The Guide provides many practical examples. The core principles are presented below.

:::Note
The sequence in which the metadata elements are created when documenting a dataset using R or Python does not have to match the sequence in the schema documentation. :::

### Interpreting the metadata documentation (API)

The metadata schemas are [documented on-line](https://ihsn.github.io/nada-api-redoc/catalog-admin/#). In this documentation, curly brackets indicate that a list (in R) or a dictionary (in Python) must be created to store the metadata elements. Square brackets indicate that a block of elements (the list or dictionary) is repeatable, i.e. in R a list of list(s) will be expected. For example (extracted from the [DOCUMENT]((https://ihsn.github.io/nada-api-redoc/catalog-admin/#operation/createDocument)) metadata schema): 

**In R:**

</center>

**In Python:** (note that double quotes can be substituted to single quotes)

<center>
![](./images/JSON_to_Python_interpret.JPG){width=100%}
</center>

<br>


:::idea
Dictionaries in Python are very similar to JSON schemas. When documenting a dataset, data curators who use Python can copy a schema from the ReDoc website, paste it in their script editor, then fill out the relevant metadata elements and delete the ones that are not used.

Not only can metadata be generated using R or Python (or other programming languages), they can also be published in a NADA catalog using R or Python, using the NADA API and the R package NADAR or the Python library PyNADA. The next sections provide examples of the programmatic generation and publishing of metadata in a catalog.

### Generating compliant metadata using R

Metadata compliant with a standard/schema can be generated using R, and directly uploaded in a NADA catalog without having to be saved as a JSON file. An object (a list) must be created in the R script that contains metadata compliant with the JSON schema. The example below shows how such an object is created and published in a NADA catalog. We assume here that we have a document with the following information: 

   - document unique id: *ABC123* 
   - title: *Teaching in Lao PDR*
   - authors: *Luis Benveniste, Jeffery Marshall, Lucrecia Santibañez (World Bank)*
   - date published: *2007*
   - countries: *Lao PDR*. 
   - The document is available from the World Bank Open knowledge Repository at http://hdl.handle.net/10986/7710.   

We will use the [DOCUMENT schema](https://ihsn.github.io/nada-api-redoc/catalog-admin/#tag/Documents) to document the publication, and the [EXTERNAL RESOURCE schema](https://ihsn.github.io/nada-api-redoc/catalog-admin/#tag/External-resources) to publish a link to the document in NADA.

<center>
![](./images/ReDoc_documents_21.JPG){width=100%}
</center>
<br>

Publishing data and metadata in a NADA catalog (using R and the NADAR package or Python and the PyNADA library) requires that we first identify the on-line catalog where the metadata will be published (by providing its URL in the `set_api_url` command line) and provide a key to authenticate as a catalog administrator (in the `set_api_key` command line; this key should not be entered in clear in a script to avoid accidental disclosure). 

We then create an object (a list in R, or a dictionary in Python) that we will name *my_doc* (this is a user-defined name, not an imposed name). Within this list (or dictionary), we will enter all metadata elements, some of which can be simple elements, while others are lists (or dictionaries). The first element to be included is the `document_description`, which is required. Within it, we add the `title_statement` which is also required and contains the mandatory elements `idno` and `title` (all documents must have a unique ID number for cataloguing purpose, and a title). The list of countries that the document covers is a <u>repeatable</u> element, i.e. a list of lists (although we only have one country in this case). Information on the authors is also a repeatable element, allowing us to capture the information on the three co-authors individually. 

This *my_doc* object is then published in the NADA catalog using the `add_document` command. Last, we publish (as an external resource) a link to the file, with only basic information. We do not need to document this resource in detail, as it corresponds to the metadata provided in *my_doc*. If we had a different external resource (for example an MS-Excel table that contains all tables shown in the publication), we would make use of more of the external resources metadata elements to document it. Note that instead of a URL, we could have provided a path to an electronic file (e.g., to the PDF document), in which case the file would be uploaded to the web server and made available directly from the on-line catalog. We had previously captured a screenshot of the cover page of the document to be used as thumbnail in the catalog (optional).

```{r eval=F, echo=T}

library(nadar)

# Define the NADA catalog URL and provide an API key

set_api_url("http://nada-demo.ihsn.org/index.php/api/")
set_api_key("a1b2c3d4e5")  
    # Note: an administrator API key must always be kept strictly confidential; 
    # It is good practice to read it from an external file, not to enter it in clear 

thumb  <- "C:/DOCS/teaching_lao.JPG"  # Cover page image to be used as thumbnail

# Generate and publish the metadata on the publication

doc_id <- "ABC001" 

my_doc <- list(

   document_description = list(
   
      title_statement = list(
        idno = doc_id, 
        title = "Teaching in Lao PDR"
      ),
      
      date_published = "2007",
  
      ref_country = list(
        list(name = "Lao PDR",  code = "LAO")
      ),
      
      # Authors: we only have one author, but this is a list of lists 
      # as the 'authors' element is a repeatable element in the schema
      authors = list(
        list(first_name = "Luis",     last_name = "Benveniste", affiliation = "World Bank"),
        list(first_name = "Jeffery",  last_name = "Marshall",   affiliation = "World Bank"),
        list(first_name = "Lucrecia", last_name = "Santibañez", affiliation = "World Bank")
      )
   )
)

# Publish the metadata in the central catalog 

add_document(idno = doc_id, 
             metadata = my_doc, 
             repositoryid = "central", 
             published = 1,
             thumbnail = thumb,
             overwrite = "yes")

# Add a link as an external resource of type document/analytical (doc/anl).

external_resources_add(
  title = "Teaching in Lao PDR",
  idno = doc_id,
  dctype = "doc/anl",
  file_path = "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/7710",
  overwrite = "yes"
)

```

The document is now available in the NADA catalog.

</center>


### Generating compliant metadata using Python

In Python, the same process is implemented by creating a *dictionary* containing all required elements. Within this dictionary, metadata elements may be store as dictionaries or, for repeatable elements, as lists of dictionaries. The Python equivalent of the R example provided above is as follows:

```{python eval=F, echo=T}

import pynada as nada

# Define the NADA catalog URL and provide an API key

set_api_url("http://nada-demo.ihsn.org/index.php/api/")
set_api_key("a1b2c3d4e5")  
    # Note: an administrator API key must always be kept strictly confidential; 
    # It is good practice to read it from an external file, not to enter it in clear  

thumb  <- "C:/DOCS/teaching_lao.JPG"  # Cover page image to be used as thumbnail

# Generate and publish the metadata on the publication

doc_id = "ABC001"

document_description = {

  'title_statement': {
      'idno': "ABC001",
      'title': "Teaching in Lao PDR"
  },
  
  'date_published': "2007",

  'ref_country': [
		{'name': "Lao PDR", 'code': "Lao"}
	],
  
  # Authors: we only have one author, but this is a list of lists 
  # as the 'authors' element is a repeatable element in the schema
  'authors': [
      {'first_name': "Luis",     'last_name': "Benveniste", 'affiliation' = "World Bank"},
      {'first_name': "Jeffery",  'last_name': "Marshall",   'affiliation' = "World Bank"},
      {'first_name': "Lucrecia", 'last_name': "Santibañez", 'affiliation' = "World Bank"},
  ]
}

# Publish the metadata in the central catalog 

nada.create_document_dataset(
  dataset_id = doc_id,
  repository_id = "central",
  published = 1,
  overwrite = "yes",
  my_doc_metadata,             @@@@@@
  thumbnail_path = thumb)

# Add a link as an external resource of type document/analytical (doc/anl).

nada.add_resource(
  dataset_id = doc_id,
  dctype = "doc/anl",
  title = "Teaching in Lao PDR",
  file_path = "http://hdl.handle.net/10986/7710",
  overwrite = "yes")

```


### Generating compliant metadata using metadata editors

R and Python are powerful tools to generate metadata in a flexible and efficient manner. They offer opportunities to automate tasks, to extract metadata from APIs or data files, to augment metadata, and to provide full transparency and replicability in the metadata production process. But this requires a certain level of expertise in R or Python. To support users who do not have such expertise, and to facilitate the use of complex metadata standards, specialized *metadata editors* have been developed to document certain types of data, in particular microdata (with the DDI metadata standard) and geospatial data (with the ISO 19139 metadata standard).

The [Nesstar Publisher](http://www.nesstar.com/software/publisher.html) is a popular DDI metadata editor used to document microdata. The application, developed and published by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data, was built around the DDI Codebook 1.n version. It also makes use of Dublin Core elements to document external resources. The application, built on an outdated technology and DDI version, is however not maintained anymore. The World Bank has initiated the development of a more modern and open source version of this application, compatible with the most recent version of DDI Codebook (and other metadata standards). 

For documenting geographic datasets and services, the [GeoNetwork metadata editor](https://geonetwork-opensource.org/), an [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) project, supports ISO 19115/19119/19110 standards. Other tools like the open-source R package [geometa](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geometa/index.html) (*Tools for Reading and Writing ISO/OGC Geographic Metadata*) can also help data curators in the production of structured metadata.
