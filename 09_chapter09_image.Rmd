## Image metadata 

This chapter describes the use of two metadata standards for the documentation of images. Images may include both electronic and physical representations, but we are here interested in images available as electronic files, intended to be catalogued and published in on-line catalogs/albums. These files will typically be available in one of the following formats: JPG, PNG, or TIFF. Images can be photos taken by digital cameras, images generated by computer, or scanned images. The metadata standards we describe are intended to make these images discoverable, accessible, and usable. For that purpose, metadata must be provided on the content of the image (in the form of caption, description, keywords, etc.), on the location and date the image was generated, on the author, and more. Information on use license and copyrights, on possible privacy protection issues (persons, possibly minors, etc.) is needed to provide users with information they need to ensure their use of the data is legal.

The device used to generate images in the form of electronic files (such as digital cameras) contain embedded metadata. Digital cameras generate EXIF metadata. This information may be useful to some users, but (with a few exceptions like the date the photo was taken and the GPS location if generated), they lack information on the content of the image (what is represented in it), required for discoverability. This information must added by curators. Part of it will be entered manually, other can be extracted in a largely automated manner using machine learning models and APIs. This information must be structured and stored in compliance with a metadata standard. We present in this chapter two standards that can serve that purpose: the comprehensive (and somewhat complex) [IPTC standard](https://iptc.org/), and the simpler [Dublin Core (DCMI)](https://dublincore.org/) standard. The metadata schema we propose embeds both options; when using the schema, users will select either one or the other to document their images. We also make references to the [ImageObject metadata schema](https://schema.org/ImageObject) from schema.org, and include some of their elements in our schema.

> "Although photographs may be more explicit than a long discourse for humans, they don't describe themselves in term of content as texts do. For texts, authors use many clues to indicate what they are talking about: titles, abstract, keywords, etc. which may be used for automatic cataloguing. Searching for photos must rely on manual cataloguing, or relate texts and documents that come with the photos." *(Source: 
https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.43.5077&rep=rep1&type=pdf)*

We start with a brief presentation of the EXIF metadata, then describe the schema we propose for the documentation and cataloguing of images. 

### Embedded metadata: EXIF

Modern digital cameras automatically generate metadata and embed it into the image file. This metadata is known as the Exchangeable Image File Format or EXIF. EXIF will record information on the date and time the image was taken, on the GPS location coordinates (latitude & longitude, possibly altitude) if the camera was equipped with a GPS and geolocation was enabled, information on the device including manufacturer and model, technical information (lens type, focal range, aperture, shutter speed, flash settings), the system-generated unique image identifier, and more.

There are several ways to extract or view an image's EXIF Data. For example, the R packages ExifTool and ExifR allow extraction and use of EXIF metadata; or applications like Flickr will display EXIF content.

<br>
![](./images/schema_guide_exif_01.JPG){width=100%}
<br>

But with the exception of the date, location (if captured), and unique image identifier, the content of the EXIF does not provide information that users interested in identifying images based on their source and/or content will find useful. Most of the image metadata will have to be obtained from another source or using other tools.   

### IPTC and Dublin Core standards 

The metadata schema we propose for documenting images contains two options: the Dublin Core, as a simple option, and the IPTC as a more complex and advanced solutions. The schema also contains a few metadata elements that will be used no matter which option is selected. The schema is structured as follows:

   - A few elements are provided to document the metadata (not the image itself), to provide some cataloguing parameters, and to set a unique identifier for the image being documented. 

   - Then come the two options for documenting the image itself: the IPTC block of metadata elements, and the Dublin Core block of elements. Users will make use of one of them, not both.

      - The IPTC is the most detailed and complex schema. The version embedded in our schema is 2019.1 According to the [IPTC website](https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/iptc-standard/), *"The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard is the most widely used standard to describe photos, because of its universal acceptance among news agencies, photographers, photo agencies, libraries, museums, and other related industries. It structures and defines metadata properties that allow users to add precise and reliable data about images."* The IPTC standard consists of two schemas: IPTC Core and IPTC Extension. They provide a comprehensive set of fields to document an image including information on time and geographic coverage, people and objects shown in the image, information on rights, and more. The schema is complex and in most cases only a small subset of fields will be used to document an image. Controlled vocabularies are recommended for some elements. 

      - The Dublin Core (DCMI) is a much simpler and highly flexible standard, composed of 15 core elements which we supplement with a few additional elements mostly taken from the ImageObject schema.  

   - Last, a small number of additional metadata elements are provided, which will apply no matter which option is used to document the image. 


### Augmenting image metadata

To make images discoverable, metadata that describe the content depicted in an image, the source of the image and the rights and licensing associated with it, are essential but not provided in the EXIF. Additional metadata must be provided. The metadata schema we propose is intended to structure the detailed metadata that can be associated with an image.

Some of these metadata will have to be generated by image authors and/or curators, other can be generated in a much automated manner using machine learning models and tools. Image processing algorithms that make it possible to augmented metadata include algorithms of face detection, person identification, automated labeling, text extraction, and others. Before describing the proposed metadata schema in the following sections, we present here some example of tools that make such metadata enhancement easy and affordable. 

The example we provide below makes use of the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/drag-and-drop) to generate image metadata. Google Vision is one out of multiple tools that can be used for that purpose such as [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), or [Microsoft Azure Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/). This example makes use of a photo selected from the [World Bank Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/1543136297/in/album-72157634086023459/).

<center>
![](./images/Google_Vision_00.JPG){width=100%}
</center>

The image comes with a brief description that identifies the photographer, the location (name of the country and town, not GPS location), and the content of the image. The description of the image includes important keywords that, when indexed in a catalog, will support discoverability of the image. This information, to be manually entered, is valuable and must be part of the curated image metadata.

But we can add useful additional information in an automated manner and at low cost using machine learning models. In the example below, we use the (free) on-line ["Try it" tool](https://cloud.google.com/vision) of the Google Vision application. 

<center>
![](./images/Google_Vision_01.JPG){width=85%}
</center>

The Google Vision API returns and displays the results of the image processing in multiple tabs. The same content is available programmatically in JSON format. The content of this JSON file can be mapped to elements of the metadata schema, for automatic addition to the image metadata.

The first tab is the result of **faces** detection. Each detected face has a bounding box and metadata such as the derived emotion of the person. The bounding box can be used to automatically flag images that have one or multiple "significant size" face(s) and may have to be excluded from the published images for privacy protection reasons.

The second tab reports on detected **objects**.

<center>
![](./images/Google_Vision_03.JPG){width=85%}
</center>

The third tab suggests **labels** that could be attached to the image, provided with a degree of confidence. A threshold can be set to automatically add (or not) each proposed label as a keyword in the image metadata.  

<center>
![](./images/Google_Vision_04.JPG){width=85%}
</center>

![](./images/Google_Vision_04a.JPG){width=30%}
![](./images/Google_Vision_04b.JPG){width=30%}
![](./images/Google_Vision_04c.JPG){width=30%}

The fourth tab shows the **text** detected in the image. The quality of text detection and recognition depends on the resolution of the image and on the size and orientation of the text in the image. In our example, the algorithm fails to read (most of) the small, rotated and truncated text. 

<center>
![](./images/Google_Vision_06.JPG){width=65%}
</center>

The tool managed to recognize some, but not all characters. In this case, this would be considered as not useful information to be added to the image metadata.

<center>
![](./images/Google_Vision_05.JPG){width=85%}
</center>

We are not interested in the **properties** tab which does not provide information that can be used for discoverability of images based on their content or source.

The last tab, **Safe search**, could be used as warnings if you plan to make the image publicly accessible.

This "Try it" tool demonstrates the capabilities of the application which, for automating the processing of a collection of images, would be accessed programmatically using R, Python or another programming language. We provide an example of such a script in the *Example 3* section of this chapter. Accessing the application's API requires a key. The cost of image labeling, face detection, and other image processing is low. The table below shows as an example the [Google vision pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing) as of 26 February 2021. Pricing from equivalent service by other companies is very similar.

## Schema description

The schema contains two options to document images: the IPTC and the Dublin Core metadata standards. The schema contains four main groups of metadata elements: 
(i) A small set of "common elements" (used no matter what option -- IPTC or Dublin Core -- is used), used mostly for cataloguing purpose. 
(ii) The IPTC metadata elements
(iii) The Dublin Core (DCMI) elements
(iv) Another small set of common elements.

The description of IPTC metadata elements is largely taken from the Photo Metadata section of the [IPTC website](https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/).

![](./images/ReDoc_image_01.JPG){width=100%}

### Common elements {-}

- **`metadata_information`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable]* <br> 
This block is used to describe who produced the metadata and when. This is an optional section of the schema. It is useful for archivist more than data users. The description of the image itself is found in the `IPTC` or `DCMI` section.
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_image_02.JPG){width=100%} 
  <br>
  
  - **`title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The title of the image metadata. This can be the same as the image title.
  
  - **`idno`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The unique identifier of the image metadata document.
  
  - **`producers`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]*  <br>
  This is a list of producers involved in the documentation (production of the metadata) of the image. 
      - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]*  <br>
      The name of the agency that is responsible for the documentation of the image. 
      - **`abbr`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]*  <br>
      Abbreviation (acronym) of the agency mentioned in `name`.
      - **`affiliation`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]*  <br>
      Affiliation of the agency mentioned in `name`.
      - **`role`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]*  <br>
    The specific role of the agency mentioned in `name` in the production of the metadata. This element will be used when more than one person or organization is listed in the `producers` element to distinguish the specific contribution of each metadata producer.<br>
    
  - **`production_date`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]*  <br>   
  The date the image metadata was generated (not the date the image was created), preferably entered in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM or YYYY).
  
  - **`version`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]* <br>
  The version of the metadata on this image. This element will rarely be used.

- **`image_description`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable]* <br>
The `image_description` will contain the metadata related to one image. DC or IPTC.

  - **`idno`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable, String]* <br>
  The (main) unique identifier of the image, to be used for cataloguing purpose.
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_image_02b.JPG){width=100%} 
  <br>
  
  - **`identifiers`** *[Optional, Repeatable]* <br>
  The repeatable element `identifiers` is used to list image identifiers other than the one used in `idno`. Some images may have unique identifiers assigned by different organizations or cataloguing systems; this element is used to document them. 
     <br>
     ![](./images/ReDoc_image_02a.JPG){width=100%} 
     <br>
     - **`type`** *[Optional, Not Repeatable, String]*
     The type of identifiers. This could be for example "DOI", or the identification of the organization or catalog that issued the identifier.
     - **`identifier`** *[Required, Not Repeatable, String]*
     The identifier itself.

### IPTC {-}

  - **`iptc`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable]* <br>
  The schema provides two options (standards) to document an image: the IPTC, and the Dublin Core. Only one of these standards, not both, will be used to document an image. The block `iptc` will be used when IPTC is the preferred option. In such case, the `dcmi` block describe later in this chapter will be left empty. IPTC is the most complex of these two options. 
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_image_03.JPG){width=100%}
  <br>
   - **`photoVideoMetadataIPTC`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   Contains all elements used to describe the image using the IPTC standard.

      - **`title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_04.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      The title is a shorthand reference for the digital image. It provides a short verbal and human readable name which can be a text and/or a numeric reference. It is not the same as the Headline (see below). Some may use the `title` field to store the file name of the image, though the field may be used in many ways. This element should not be used to provide the unique ID of the image, as such identifiers are captured in the `Registry Entry` property.
      
      - **`imageSupplierImageId`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      A unique identifier assigned by the Image Supplier to the image.
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_05.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      
      - **`registryEntries`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
      A structured element used to provide cataloguing information (i.e. an entry in a registry). It includes the unique identifier for the image issued by the registry and the registry’s organization identifier. 
        <br>
        ![](./images/ReDoc_image_06.JPG){width=100%}
        <br>
         - **`role`**: *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
         An identifier of the reason and/or purpose for this Registry Entry.
         - **`assetIdentifier`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
         A unique identifier created by the registry and applied by the creator of the digital image. This value shall not be changed after being applied. This identifier is linked to a corresponding Registry Organization Identifier. Enter the unique identifier created by a registry and applied by the creator of the digital image. This value shall not be changed after being applied. This identifier may be globally unique by itself, but it must be unique for the issuing registry. An input to this field should be made mandatory.
         - **`registryIdentifier`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
         An identifier for the registry/organization which issued the corresponding Registry Image Id. 
      
      - **`digitalImageGuid`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_07.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      A globally unique identifier for the image. This identifier is created and applied by the creator of the digital image at the time of its creation. This value shall not be changed after that time. The identifier can be generated using an algorithm that would guarantee that the created identifier is globally unique. Device that create digital images like digital or video cameras or scanners usually create such an identifier at the time of the creation of the digital data, and add it to the metadata embedded in the image file (e.g., the EXIF metadata).IPTC’s requirements for unique ids are as follows:
         - It must be globally unique. Algorithms for this purpose exist.
         - It should identify the camera body.
         - It should identify each individual photo from this camera body.
         - It should identify the date and time of the creation of the picture.
         - It should be secured against tampering.

      - **`dateCreated`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_08.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      Designates the date and optionally the time the content of the image was created. For a photo, this will be the date and time the photo was taken. When no information is available on the time, the time is set to 00:00:00. The preferred format for the `dateCreated` element is the truncated DateTime format, for example: 2021-02-22T21:24:06Z

      - **`headline`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_09.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      A brief publishable summary of the contents of the image. Note that a headline is not the same as a title.
      
      - **`eventName`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_10.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      The name or a brief description of the event where the image was taken. If this is a sub-event of a larger event, mention both in the description. For example: "Opening statement, 1st International Conference on Metadata Standards, New York, November 2021". 
      
      - **`description`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_11.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      A textual description, including captions, of the image. This describes the who, what, and why of what is happening in this image. This might include names of people, and/or their role in the action that is taking place within the image. Example: "The president of the Metadata Association delivers the keynote address".
      
      - **`captionWriter`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_12.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>
      An identifier, or the name, of the person involved in writing, editing or correcting the description of the image. 
      
      - **`keywords`**: *[Optional ; Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_13.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>      
      Keywords (terms or phrases) to express the subject of the image. Keywords do not have to be taken from a controlled vocabulary.  

      - **`sceneCodes`** *[Optional ; Repeatable ; String]* <br>
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_14.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>         
      The `sceneCodes` describe the scene of a photo content. The [IPTC Scene-NewsCodes](http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/scene) controlled vocabulary (published under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 4.0 license) should be used, where a scene is represented as a string of 6 digits.

### Dublin Core {-}

We introduced the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) specification in chapter 3 - Documents. It contains 15 core elements, which are generic and versatile enough to be used for documenting different types of resources. Other elements can be added to the specification to increase its relevancy for specific uses. In the schema we recommend for the documentation of publications, we added elements inspired by the MARC 21 standard. We take a similar approach for the use of the Dublin Core for documenting images, by adding elements inspired by the [ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject) schema from schema.org to the 15 elements.

The fifteen elements, with their definition extracted from the [Dublin Core website](https://dublincore.org/), are the following:

| Element name         | Description                                                      | 
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| identifier           | An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context. |
| type                 | The nature or genre of the resource.                             |
| title                | A name given to the resource.                                    |
| description          | An account of the resource.                                      |
| subject              | The topic of the resource.                                       |
| creator              | An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.         |
| contributor          | An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.  |
| publisher            | An entity responsible for making the resource available.         |
| date                 | A point or period of time associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource. |
| coverage             | The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.|
| format               | The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource. |
| language             | A language of the resource.                                      |
| relation             | A related resource.                                              |
| rights               | Information about rights held in and over the resource.          |
| source               | A related resource from which the described resource is derived. |

We do not use the `identifier` element, as we already have a unique identifier in the common element `idno`. 

We add the following elements, not part of the core list of the DCMI: 

   - identifiers
   - caption
   - keywords
   - topics
   - country
   - gps (latitude, longitude, altitude)
   - note

The common additional elements `license`, `album` and `tags` also complement the DCMI metadata (see section **`Additional elements`**).

We describe below how DCMI elements are used to document images. 

  - **`dcmi`** *[Optional, Not repeatable]* <br>
  Users of the schema will chose either IPTC or Dublin Core (not both) to document their images. If the choice is Dublin Core, the elements under `dcmi` will be used. 
      <br>
      ![](./images/ReDoc_image_51.JPG){width=100%}
      <br>  
    - **`type`** *[Required, Not Repeatable, String]* <br>
    The Dublin Core schema is flexible and versatile, and can be used to document different types of resources. This element is used to document the type of resource being documented. The DCMI provides a list of suggested categories, including "image" which is the relevant type to be entered here. Some users may want to be more specific in the description of the type of resource, for example distinguishing color from black & white images. This distinction should not be made in this element; another element can be used for such purpose (like tags and tag groups). 
    
    - **`title`** *[Optional, Not Repeatable, String]* <br> 
    The title of the photo. 
    
    - **caption`** *[Optional, Not Repeatable, String]* <br>
    A caption for the photo. 
    
    - **`description`** *[Optional, Not Repeatable, String]* <br>
    A brief description of the content depicted in the image. This element will typically provide more detailed information than the title or caption. Note that other elements can be used to provide a more specific and "itemized" description of an image; the element `keywords` for example can be used to list labels associated with an image (possibly generated in an automated manner using machine learning tools).
    
    - **`subject`** *[Optional, Not Repeatable, String]* <br> 
    The topic of the resource, described in a narrative manner.
    
    - **`topics`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]*<br>
    The `topics` field indicates the broad substantive topic(s) that the image represents. A topic classification facilitates referencing and searches in electronic survey catalogs. Topics should be selected from a standard controlled vocabulary such as the [Council of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) thesaurus](https://vocabularies.cessda.eu/vocabulary/TopicClassification). The [Library of Congress Subject Headings](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCSH/freelcsh.html) may also be used here.<br>
        <br>

        The label of the topic associated with the data.  
        - **`parent_id`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        When a hierarchical (nested) controlled vocabulary is used, the `parent_id` field can be used to indicate a higher-level topic to which this topic belongs.
        - **`vocabulary`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The name of the controlled vocabulary used, if any. 
        - **`uri`** <br>

    - **`keywords`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
    Words or phrases that describe salient aspects of an image content. Can be used for building keyword indexes and for classification and retrieval purposes. A controlled vocabulary can be employed. Keywords should be selected from a standard thesaurus, preferably an international, multilingual thesaurus. <br>
       <br>
       ![](./images/ReDoc_image_54.JPG){width=100%}
       <br>

![](./images/ReDoc_Table_35.JPG){width=100%}  @@@@@@@ take specific screenshot
<br>
Metadata can be programmatically harvested from external catalogs. The `provenance` group of elements is used to store information on the provenance of harvested metadata, and on alterations that may have been done to the harvested metadata. These elements are NOT part of the IPTC or DCMI metadata standard.
   - **`origin_description`** *[Required ; Not repeatable]* <br>
   The `origin_description` elements are used to describe when and from where metadata have been extracted or harvested.  
      - **`harvest_date`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The date and time the metadata were harvested, in ISO 8601 format.
      - **`altered`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; Boolean]* <br>
      A boolean variable ("true" or "false"; "true by default) indicating whether the harvested metadata have been modified before being re-published. In many cases, the unique identifier of the study (element `idno` in the Study Description / Title Statement section) will be modified when published in a new catalog.
      - **`base_url`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The URL from where the metadata were harvested.
      - **`identifier`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The unique dataset identifier (`idno` element) in the source catalog. When harvested metadata are re-published in a new catalog, the identifier will likely be changed. The `identifier` element in `provenance` is used to maintain traceability.
      - **`date_stamp`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The datestamp (in UTC date format) of the metadata record in the originating repository (this should correspond to the date the metadata were last updated in the source catalog).
      - **`metadata_namespace`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      @@@@@@@ 

- **`tags`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
Tags provides easy way to include custom-facets in NADA. Should consider using one or multiple controlled vocabulary(ies). See section 1.7 for more on the importance and use of tags and tag_groups in data catalogs.
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_image_61.JPG){width=100%}
   <br> 
    - **`tag`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
    A user-defined tag.
    - **`tag_group`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br><br>
    A user-defined group to which the tag belongs. Grouping tags allows implementation of controlled facets (filters) in data catalogs.

## Examples 

Use schema and resource schema for publishing links.

### Example

We selected an image from the World Bank Flickr collection. The image is available at https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/8120361619/in/album-72157648790716931/
Some metadata is provided with the photo. 

<center>
![](./images/Image_Example_01a.JPG){width=80%}
</center>

Metadata:

<center>
![](./images/Image_Example_01b.JPG){width=80%}
</center>

The image is made available in multiple formats. We assume that we want to only provide access to the small, medium and original version of the image available in our NADA catalog. We also assume that instead of uploading the images to our catalog server to make them available directly from our catalog, we want to provide link to the images in the source repository (Flickr in this case).
