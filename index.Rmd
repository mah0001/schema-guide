Many organizations --national and international, governmental and non-governmental-- invest in the collection and creation of data. Most of these data have value not only for their producer or sponsor, but also for the vast community of secondary users and researchers. By re-purposing and re-using data, this community contributes to add social and economic value to data. But many valuable datasets remain difficult to find, access, and use, and are therefore under-exploited. To be used more extensively, action must be taken to improve the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of data, which depend very much on the quality of the associated metadata. This document is a guide on the use of metadata standards and schemas for the documentation of socio-economic data of different types. Its objective is to promote and facilitate the production and exploitation of rich and structured metadata with an ultimate goal to foster the responsible use of existing data. 

The target audience for this Guide comprises data curators and administrators of data catalogs or data libraries, and the developers of data management and dissemination platforms.

The Guide was produced as a component of a toolset that also includes a specialized metadata editor and a cataloguing tool. These tools aim to address the technical issues of data documentation and dissemination. The legal and ethical aspects are equally important. Other tools and guidelines are available that provide recommendations on data protection (statistical disclosure control), and on data dissemination policies. 

## Acknowledgments {-}

The Guide was written by Olivier Dupriez (Lead Data Scientist, World Bank) and Mehmood Asghar (Senior Data Engineer, World Bank). Kamwoo Lee (Data Scientist, World Bank) produced some of the examples of the use of metadata schemas included in the Guide and contributed to the testing of the schemas. Emmanuel Blondel (consultant) contributed much of chapter 6. Geoffrey Greenwell (consultant) provided input to chapter 9. Tefera Bekele Degefu and Cathrine Machingauta (Data Scientists, World Bank) participated in the testing of the metadata schemas. Matthew Welch (Senior Economist-Statistician, World Bank) provided comments on the Guide.

The production of the Guide and related tools has been made possible by financial contributions from:

   - The [International Household Survey Network (IHSN)](www.ihsn.org) Trust Fund, project P167116, Grant No TF0A7461, by the UK government.
   - The UK Aid-UNHCR-World Bank research program Building the Evidence on Protracted Forced Displacement, funded by the UK government (FCV Data Platform component, project P174529, Grant No TF0B4149). This project supported the development of a data platform which led to the improvement and testing of some of the metadata schemas described in the Guide.
   - The World Bank-UNHCR Joint Data Center Microdata Library project P174080, Grant No TF0B4772, administered by the World Bank Development Data Group.
   - The World Bank administrative budget.
