The objective of the Guide is to promote the use of rich and structured metadata to improve data discoverability, accessibility, usability, and use. Although the volume and diversity of data made available to the research community are growing fast, many valuable datasets remain under-exploited. To foster their (responsible) use, data must be made easy to locate, access, and analyze in compliance with legal and ethical principles. The discoverability and usability of data depend largely on the quality of the associated metadata, which itself can be increased when metadata standards and schemas are adopted. This Guide is primarily intended to advocate for, and facilitate, the adoption of such standards and schemas. It was written as a companion to other tools and guidelines, including the open-source [NADA cataloguing](http://nada.ihsn.org/) application and the related R package NADAR and Python library PyNADA. The relevancy and use of standards and schemas is however not limited to these specific solutions.

The Guide was written by Olivier Dupriez (Lead Statistician, World Bank) and Mehmood Asghar (Senior Data Engineer, World Bank). Kamwoo Lee (Data Scientist, World Bank) produced multiple examples of the use of metadata schemas included in the Guide; he also played a critical role in the testing of the schemas and led the development of PyNADA. Matthew Welch (Senior Economist-Statistician, World Bank) provided comments on the Guide. Thijs Benschop (Data Scientist, World Bank) contributed to the development of NADAR. Emmanuel Blondel (Consultant) contributed much of chapter 6. Geoffrey Greenwell (Consultant) provided input to chapter 8. Tefera Bekele Degefu and Cathrine Machingauta (Data SCientists, World Bank) participated in the testing of the schemas and packages.

The production of the Guide and related tools has been made possible by financial contributions from the following sponsors:

   - The [International Household Survey Network (IHSN)](www.ihsn.org) Trust Fund, project P167116, Grant No TF0A7461, by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom (formerly the Department for International Development - DfID).
   - The UK-UNHCR-World Bank research program on forced displacement by FCDO (FCV Data Platform component, project P174529, Grant No TF0B4149). This project did not specifically sponsor the production of the Guide, but supported the development of a data platform which led to the improvement and testing of some of the metadata schemas described in the Guide.
   - The World Bank - UNHCR Joint Data Center's Microdata Library project P174080, Grant No TF0B4772, administered by the World Bank Development Data Group.
   - The World Bank administrative budget.

We also express gratitude to the providers of open-source solutions used for the production of the Guide and for the exploitation of the metadata standards and schemas we describe, and to the developers and providers of metadata standards.
