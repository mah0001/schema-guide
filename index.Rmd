The volume and diversity of data made available to the research community are growing fast. But too many valuable datasets remain under-exploited. To be used more extensively, data must be made easier to find, understand, access, and analyze. The discoverability, accessibility, and usability of data depend very much on the quality of the associated metadata. The documentation, cataloguing, and dissemination of data and metadata must be improved. 

This document is a guide on the use of metadata standards and schemas for the documentation of socio-economic data of different types. Its objective is to promote and facilitate the production and exploitation of rich and structured metadata. It was written as a companion guide to a suite of open source tools, including the [NADA cataloguing](http://nada.ihsn.org/) application and a specialized, multi-standard Metadata Editor. 

The Guide was written by Olivier Dupriez (Lead Data Scientist, World Bank) and Mehmood Asghar (Senior Data Engineer, World Bank). Kamwoo Lee (Data Scientist, World Bank) produced some of the examples of the use of metadata schemas included in the Guide and contributed to the testing of the schemas. Emmanuel Blondel (consultant) contributed much of chapter 6. Geoffrey Greenwell (consultant) provided input to chapter 8. Tefera Bekele Degefu and Cathrine Machingauta (Data Scientists, World Bank) participated in the testing of the metadata schemas. Matthew Welch (Senior Economist-Statistician, World Bank) provided comments on the Guide.

The production of the Guide and related tools has been made possible by financial contributions from:

   - The [International Household Survey Network (IHSN)](www.ihsn.org) Trust Fund, project P167116, Grant No TF0A7461, by the UK government.
   - The UK Aid-UNHCR-World Bank research program Building the Evidence on Protracted Forced Displacement, funded by the UK government (FCV Data Platform component, project P174529, Grant No TF0B4149). This project supported the development of a data platform which led to the improvement and testing of some of the metadata schemas described in the Guide.
   - The World Bank-UNHCR Joint Data Center Microdata Library project P174080, Grant No TF0B4772, administered by the World Bank Development Data Group.
   - The World Bank administrative budget.
