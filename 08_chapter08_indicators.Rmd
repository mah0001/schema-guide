##	Indicators, time series, database, and scope of the schema

**Indicators** are summary measures related to key issues or phenomena, derived from observed facts. Indicators form **time series** when they are provided with a temporal ordering, i.e. when their values are provided with an ordered annual, quarterly, monthly, daily, or other time reference. Time series are usually published with equal intervals between values. In the context of this Guide, we however consider as time series all indicators provided for a given geographic area with an associated time reference, whether this time represents a regular, continuous succession of time stamps or not. For example, the indicators provided by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) [StatCompiler](https://www.statcompiler.com/en/), which are only available for the years when DHS are conducted in countries (which for some countries can be a single year), would be considered here as "time series".

Time series are often contained in multi-indicators databases, like the World Bank's [World Development Indicators - WDI](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/), whose on-line version contains series for 1,430 indicators (as of 2021). To document not only the series but also the databases they belong to, we propose two metadata schemas: one to document the series/indicators, the other one to document the databases they belong to. 

In the NADA application, a series can be documented and published without an associated database, but information on a database will only be published in association with a series. The information on a database is thus treated as an "attachment" to the information on a series. A **SERIES DESCRIPTION** tab will display all metadata related to the series, i.e. all content entered in the *series schema*.

The (optional) **SOURCE DATABASE** tab will display the metadata related to the database, i.e. all content entered in the *series database schema*. This information is displayed for information, but not indexed in the NADA catalog (i.e. not searchable).

**Suggestions and recommendations to data curators**

- Indicators and time series often come with metadata limited to the indicators/series name and a brief definition. This significantly reduces the discoverability of the indicators, and the possibility to implement semantic searchability and recommender systems. It is therefore highly recommended to generate more detailed metadata for each time series, including information on the purpose and typical use of the indicators, of its relevancy to different audiences, of its limitations, and more.

- When documenting an indicator or time series, attention should be paid to include keywords and phrases in the metadata that reflect how data users are likely to formulate their queries when searching data catalogs. Subject-matter expertise, combined with an analysis of queries submitted to data catalogs, can help to identify such keywords. For example, the metadata related to an indicator "Prevalence of stunting" should contain the keyword "malnutrition", and the metadata related to "GDP per capita" should include keywords like "economic growth" or "national income". By doing so, data curators will provide richer input to search engines and recommender systems, and will have a significant and direct impact on the discoverability of the data.

## Schema description

An indicator or time series is documented using the **time series /indicators** schema. The **database** schema is optional, and used to document the database, if any, that the indicator belongs to. When multiple series of a same database are documented, the metadata related to the database only needs to be generated once, then applied to all series. One metadata element in the **time series /indicators** schema is used to link an indicator to the corresponding database.

### The time series (indicators) schema

The time series schema is used to document an indicator or a time series. In NADA, the data and metadata of an indicator can (but does not have to) be published with information on the database it belongs to (if any). A metadata element is provided to indicate the identifier of that database (if any), and to establish the link between the indicator metadata and the database metadata generated using the schema described above.

#### Cataloguing parameters

The first elements of the schema (`repositoryid`, `access_policy`, `data_remote_url`, `published`, and `overwrite`) are not part of the series metadata. They are parameters used to indicate how the series will be published in a NADA catalog. 

**`repositoryid`** identifies the collection in which the metadata will be published. By default, the metadata will be published in the central catalog. To publish them in a collection, the collection must have been previously created in NADA. 

**`access_policy`** indicates the access policy to be applied to the data: direct access, open access, public use files, licensed access, data accessible from an external repository, and data not accessible. A controlled vocabulary is provided and must be used, with the following respective options: {`direct; open; public; licensed; remote; data_na`}.

**`data_remote_url`** provides the link to an external website where the data can be obtained, if the `access_policy` has been set to `remote`.

**`published`**: Indicates whether the metadata must be made visible to visitors of the catalog. By default, the value is 0 (unpublished). This value must be set to 1 (published) to make the metadata visible.

**`overwrite`**: Indicates whether metadata that may have been previously uploaded for the same series can be overwritten. By default, the value is "no". It must be set to "yes" to overwrite existing information. Note that a series will be considered as being the same as a previously uploaded one if the identifier provided in the metadata element `series_description > idno` is the same.

![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_03.JPG){width=100%}

  A unique identifier (ID) for the series. Most agencies and databases will have a coherent coding convention to generate their series IDs. For example, the name of the series in the World Bank's World Development Indicators series are composed of the following elements, separated by a dot:
  
  - Topic code (2 digits). 
  - General subject code (3 digits)
  - Specific subject code (4 digits)
  - Extensions (2 digits each) <br>
  
  For example, the series with identifier "DT.DIS.PRVT.CD" is the series containing data on "External debt disbursements by private creditors in current US dollars" (for more information, see [*How does the World Bank code its indicators?*]( https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/201175-how-does-the-world-bank-code-its-indicators).<br>

- **`database_id`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_05.JPG){width=100%}

  The unique identifier of the database the series belongs to. This field must correspond to the element `database_description > title_statement > idno` of the database schema described above. This is the only field that is needed to establish the link between the database metadata and the indicator metadata. 


 <!--  ___    ____   _____          _ _                      -->

- **`aliases`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
A series or an indicator can be referred to using different names. The `aliases` element is provided to capture the multiple names and labels that may be associated with (i.e synomyms of) the documented series or indicator.
  
  ![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_06.JPG){width=100%}
  - **`alias`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  An alternative name for the indicator or series being documented. <br><br>


 <!--  ___    ____    __           _ _     _     _  -->
 <!-- |__ \  |___ \  / /          | | |   (_)   | | -->

- **`alternate_identifiers`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]*<br>
The element `idno` described above is the reference unique identifier for the catalog in which the metadata is intended to be published. But the same indicator/metadata may be published in other catalogs. For example, a data catalog may publish metadata for series extracted from the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) database. And the WDI itself contains series generated and published by other organizations, such as the World Health Organization or UNICEF. Catalog administrators may want to assign a unique identifier specific to their catalog (the `idno` element), but keep track of the identifier of the series or indicator in other catalogs or databases. The `alternate_identifiers` element serves that purpose. 

  ![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_07.JPG){width=100%}
  - **`identifier`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  An identifier for the series other than the identifier entered in `idno` (note that the identifier entered in `idno` can be included in this list, if it is useful to provide it with a type identifier (see `name` element below) which is not provided in `idno`. This can be the identifier of the indicator in another database/catalog, or a global unique identifier.
  - **`name`** <br>  
  This element will be used to define the type of identifier. This will typically be used to flag DOIs by entering "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)".
  - **`database`** <br>
  The name of the database (or catalog) where this alternative identifier is used, e.g. "IMF, International Financial Statistics (IFS)".<br>
  - **`uri`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  A link (URL) to the database mentioned in `database`. <br>
  - **`notes`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  Any additional information on the alternate identifier. <br><br>

- **`languages`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  
An indicator or time series can be made available at different levels of disaggregation. For example, an indicator containing estimates of the "Population" of a country by year can be available by sex. The data curators in such case will have two options: (i) create and document three separate indicators, namely "Population, Total", "Population, Female", and "Population, Male"; or create a single indicator "Population" and attach a *dimension* "sex" to it, with values "Total", "Female", and "Male". The `dimensions` are features (or "variables") that define the different levels of disaggregation within an indicator/series. The element `dimensions` is used to provide an itemized list of disaggregations that correspond exactly to the published data. Note that when an indicator is available at two "non-overlapping" levels of disaggregation, it should be split into two indicators. For example, if the Population indicator is available by male/female and by urban/rural, but not by male/urban/male/rural/female urban/female rural, it should be treated as two separate indicators ("Population by sex" with dimension sex = "male / female" and "Population by area of residence" with dimension area = "urban / rural".) Note also that another element in the schema, `disaggregation`, is also provided, in which a narrative description of the actual or recommended disaggregations can be documented.<br>

  ![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_08b.JPG){width=100%}
  - **`name`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The name of the language.
  - **`code`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The code of the language, preferably the ISO code.<br><br>

- **`measurement_unit`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_08.JPG){width=100%}

  The unit of measurement. Note that in many databases the measurement unit will be included in the series name/label. In the World Bank's World Development Indicators for example, series are named as follows: 
  
   - CO2 emissions (kg per 2010 US$ of GDP)
   - GDP per capita (current US$)
   - GDP per capita (current LCU)
   - Population density (people per sq. km of land area)
   
  In such case, the name of the series should not be changed, but the measurement unit may be extracted from it and stored in element `measurement_unit`. <br>

- **`dimensions`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  
An indicator or time series can be made available at different levels of disaggregation. For example, an indicator containing estimates of the "Population" of a country by year can be available by sex. The data curators in such case will have two options: (i) create and document three separate indicators, namely "Population, Total", "Population, Female", and "Population, Male"; or create a single indicator "Population" and attach a *dimension* "sex" to it, with values "Total", "Female", and "Male". The `dimensions` are features (or "variables") that define the different levels of disaggregation within an indicator/series. The element `dimensions` is used to provide an itemized list of disaggregations that correspond exactly to the published data. Note that when an indicator is available at two "non-overlapping" levels of disaggregation, it should be split into two indicators. For example, if the Population indicator is available by male/female and by urban/rural, but not by male/urban/male/rural/female urban/female rural, it should be treated as two separate indicators ("Population by sex" with dimension sex = "male / female" and "Population by area of residence" with dimension area = "urban / rural".) Note also that another element in the schema, `disaggregation`, is also provided, in which a narrative description of the actual or recommended disaggregations can be documented.<br>

  ![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_08b.JPG){width=100%}
  - **`name`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The name of the dimension.
  - **`label`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The label of the dimension, for example "sex", or "urban/rural".
  - **`description`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  A description of the dimension (for example, if the label was "age group", the description can provide detailed information on the age groups, e.g. "The age groups in the database are 0-14, 15-49, 50-64, and 65+ years old".)<br><br>

  Code of the geographic unit. The [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)  code is preferred when the unit is a country.
  - **`type`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  Type of geographic unit e.g. "country", "state", "region", "province", "city", etc. <br><br>


- **`bbox`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
This element is used to define one or multiple bounding box(es), which are the rectangular fundamental geometric description of the geographic coverage of the data. A bounding box is defined by west and east longitudes and north and south latitudes, and includes the largest geographic extent of the dataset's geographic coverage. The bounding box provides the geographic coordinates of the top left (north/west) and bottom-right (south/east) corners of a rectangular area. This element can be used in catalogs as the first pass of a coordinate-based search. This element is optional, but if the `bound_poly` element (see below) is used, then the `bbox` element must be included.<br>

  ![](./images/ReDoc_Microdata_16.JPG){width=100%}
  - **`west`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  West longitude of the bounding box. <br>
  - **`east`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  East longitude of the bounding box. <br>

- **`authoring_entity`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
This set of five elements is used to identify the organization(s) or person(s) who are the main producers/curators of the indicator. Note that a similar element is provided at the database level. The authoring_entity for the indicator can be different from the authoring_entity of the database. For example, the World Bank is the authoring entity for the World Development Indicators database, which contains indicators obtained from the International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, and other organizations that are thus the authoring entitis for specific indicators.  

  ![](./images/ReDoc_ts_database_36b.JPG){width=100%}
  - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The name of the person or organization who is responsible for the production of the indicator or series. Write the name in full (use the element `abbreviation` to capture the acronym of the organization, if relevant). 
  - **`affiliation`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The affiliation of the person or organization mentioned in `name`.  
  - **`abbreviation`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  Abbreviated name (acronym) of the organization mentioned in `name`.
  - **`email`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The public email contact of the person or organizations mentioned in `name`. It is good practice to provide a service account email address, not a personal one.
  - **`uri`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  A link (URL) to the website of the entity mentioned in `name`. <br><br>

- **`sources`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
This element provides information on the source(s) of data that were used to generate the indicator. A source can refer to an organization (e.g., "Source: World Health Organization"), or to a dataset (e.g., for a national poverty headcount indicator, the sources will likely be a list of sample household surveys). In `sources`, we are mainly interested in the latter. When a series in a database is a series extracted from another database (e.g., when the World Bank World Development Indicators include a series from the World Health Organization in its database), the source organization should be mentioned in the `authoring_entity` element of the schema. The `sources` element is a repeatable element. In international databases where series cover many countries, a series may have a large number of sources (for example, the World Bank poverty headcount data are extracted from hundreds of different national household surveys). The content of this element can thus be quite large. This information is however useful, as it contributes to establish the traceability and credibility of the data.  

  ![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_37.JPG){width=100%}
  - **`id`** *[Required ; String]* <br>
  This element records the unique identifier of a source. It is a required element. If the source does not have a specific unique identifier, a sequential number can be used. If the source is a dataset or database that has its own unique identifier (possibly a DOI), this identifier should be used. 
  - **`name`** *[Optional ; String]* <br>
  The name (title, or label) of the source. 
  - **`organization`** *[Optional ; String]* <br>
  The organization responsible for the source data.

  The type of source, e.g. "household survey", "administrative data", or "external database".  
  - **`note`** *[Optional ; String]* <br>
  This element can be used to provide additional information regarding the source data.<br><br>

- **`acronyms`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
The `acronyms` element is used to document the meaning of all acronyms used in the metadata of a series. If some acronyms are well known (like "GDP", or "IMF" for example), others may be less obvious or could be uncertain (does "PPP" mean "public-private partnership", or "purchasing power parity"?). In any case, providing a list of acronyms with their meaning will help users and make your metadata more discoverable. Note that acronyms should not include country codes used in the documentation of the geographic coverage of the data.

### Tags

**`tags`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
As shown in section 1.7 of the Guide, tags, when associated with `tag_groups`, provide a powerful and flexible solution to enable custom facets (filters) in data catalogs.
![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_48.JPG){width=100%}  

- **`tag`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
A user-defined tag.
- **`tag_group`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br><br>
A user-defined group (optional) to which the tag belongs. Grouping tags allows implementation of controlled facets in data catalogs.

- **`lda_topics`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable]* <br>
![](./images/ReDoc_documents_17.JPG){width=100%}  

   We mentioned in Chapter 1 the importance of producing rich metadata, and the opportunities that machine learning offers to enrich (or "augment") metadata in a largely automated manner. One application of machine learning, more specifically of natural language processing, to enrich metadata related to publications is the topic extraction using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models. LDA models must be trained on large corpora of documents. They do not require any pre-defined taxonomy of topics. The approach consists of "clustering" words that are likely to appear in similar contexts (the number of "clusters" or "topics" is a parameter provided when training a model). Clusters of related words form "topics". A topic is thus defined by a list of keywords, each one of them provided with a score indicating its importance in the topic. Typically, the top 10 words that represent a topic will be used to describe it. The description of the topics covered by a document can be indexed to improve searchability (possibly in a selective manner, by setting thresholds on the topic shares and word weights).  

  Once an LDA topic model has been trained, it can be used to infer the topic composition of any text. In the case of indicators and time series, this text will be a concatenation of some metadata elements including the series' name, definitions, keywords, concepts, and possibly others. This inference will then provide the share that each topic represents in the metadata. The sum of all represented topics is 1 (100%). 

  The `lda_topics` element includes the following metadata fields. An example in R was provided in Chapter 4 - Documents.

    - `model_id` *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
    The unique ID given to the model.<br>
    - `nb_topics` *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; Numeric]* <br>

    - `topic_score` *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; Numeric]* <br>
    The share of the topic in the metadata (%).<br>
    - `topic_label` *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>

- **`embeddings`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
In Chapter 1 (section 1.n), we briefly introduced the concept of word embeddings and their use in implementation of semantic search tools. Word embedding models convert text (words, phrases, documents) into large-dimension numeric vectors (e.g., a vector of 100 or 200 numbers) that are representative of the semantic content of the text. The vectors are generated by submitting a text to a pre-trained word embedding model (possibly via an API). 
  
  The word vectors do not have to be stored in the series/indicator metadata to be exploited by search engines. When a semantic search tool is implemented in a catalog, the vectors will be stored in a database end processed by a tool like Milvus. A metadata element is however provided to store the vectors for preservation and sharing purposes. This block of metadata elements is repeatable, allowing multiple vectors to be stored. When using vectors in a search engine, it is critical to only use vectors generated by one same model. 
  
  ![](./images/ReDoc_ts_series_46.JPG){width=100%}
  
  The `embeddings` element contains four metadata fields:
  
  - **`id`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  A unique identifier of the word embedding model used to generate the vector.
  - **`description`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  A brief description of the model. This may include the identification of the producer, a description of the corpus on which the model was trained, the identification of the software and algorithm used to train the model, the size of the vector, etc.
  - **`date`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
  The date the model was trained (or a version date for the model).
  - **`vector`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; @@@@]* 
  The numeric vector representing the series metadata. <br><br>

### Additional

**`additional`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable]*<br>
The `additional` element allows data curators to add their own metadata elements to the schema. All custom elements must be added within the `additional` block; embedding them elsewhere in the schema would cause schema validation to fail.

## Generating and publishing compliant metadata - Complete example

We use a series from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI 2021) as an example: the series ["Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)"](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/millennium-development-goals/Series/SI.POV.DDAY)


:::note
Note that we only show how metadata are generated and published in a NADA catalog. We do not demonstrate the (optional) publishing of the underlying data in a MongoDB database, which makes the data accessible via API and allows activation of data visualizations in the NADA catalog. This is covered in the NADA documentation.

    methodology = "International comparisons of poverty estimates entail both conceptual and practical problems. Countries have different definitions of poverty, and consistent comparisons across countries can be difficult. Local poverty lines tend to have higher purchasing power in rich countries, where more generous standards are used, than in poor countries. Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (PPPs), was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when we adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. The $3.20 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Lower Middle Income. The $5.50 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Upper Middle Income. Early editions of World Development Indicators used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2011 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank. The current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the poverty lines found in 15 of the poorest countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. As a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in earlier editions. The statistics reported here are based on consumption data or, when unavailable, on income surveys. Analysis of some 20 countries for which income and consumption expenditure data were both available from the same surveys found income to yield a higher mean than consumption but also higher inequality. When poverty measures based on consumption and income were compared, the two effects roughly cancelled each other out: there was no significant statistical difference.",
    
    limitation = "Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain. The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys need to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income countries. The low frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction. Besides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries. However, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure but may not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary.",

Since then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys.
