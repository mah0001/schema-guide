The schema we propose is a combination of elements from the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](https://dublincore.org/) and from the [VideoObject (from schema.org)](https://schema.org/VideoObject) schemas. The schema is very similar to the schema used for audio files (see chapter 10). 

The Dublin Core is a generic and versatile standard, which we use (in an augmented form) for the documentation of 8Documents* (Chapter 4), *Images* (Chapter 9), and *Audio* files (chapter 10). It contains 15 core elements, to which we added a selection of elements from VideoObject. We also ensure that the structure of our video schema is, as much as possible, consistent with other schemas described in this Guide. We included the elements `keywords`, `topics`, `tags` also found in the schemas used to document microdata, documents, time series, tables, images, and scripts.  

The resulting metadata schema is simple, but it contains the elements needed to document the resources and their content in a way that will foster their discoverability in data catalogs. Compliance with the VideoObject elements contributes to search engine optimization, as search engines like Google, Bing and others "reward" metadata published in formats compatible with the schema.org recommendations.

When published in a NADA catalog, the metadata will appear in a specific tab.

<br>

## Schema description 

The first block of metadata elements, `metadata_information`, is used to document the metadata (not the video itself). This provides information useful for archiving purposes. This block is optional. It is recommended however to enter at least the identification and affiliation of the metadata producer, and the date of creation of the metadata. One reason for this is that metadata can be shared and harvested across catalogs/organizations, so metadata produced by one organization can be found in other data centers. 

**`metadata_information`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable]*
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_01.JPG){width=100%}
  <br>
   - **`title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   The title of the video.<br>
   - **`idno`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   A unique identifier for the metadata document (unique in the catalog; ideally also unique globally). This is different from the video unique ID (see `idno` element in section *video_description* below), although it is good practice to generate IDs that would maintain an easy connection between the metadata IDNO and the video IDNO.<br>
   - **`producers`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
   This refers to the producer(s) of the metadata, NOT to the producer(s) of the video. This could for example be the data curator in a data center.<br>
      - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Name of the metadata producer/curator. An alternative to entering the name of the curator (e.g. for privacy protection purpose) is to enter the curator ID (see the element *abbr* below)<br>
      - **`abbr`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Can be used to provide an ID of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
      - **`affiliation`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Affiliation of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
      - **`role`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Specific role of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
   - **`production_date`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   Date the metadata (not the table) was produced.<br>
   - **`version`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   Version of the metadata (not version of the table).<br>

**`video_description`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable]* <br>
The `video_description` section contains all elements that will be used to describe the video and its content. These are the elements that will be indexed and made searchable in data catalogs.

   - **`idno`** *[Mandatory, Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_02.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   `idno` is a unique identification number that is used to uniquely identify a video. Such a unique identifier will be required by any data catalog. It will also help users of the data cite the video properly. The best option is to obtain a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/) for the video, as it will ensure that the ID is unique globally. Alternatively, it can be an ID constructed by an organization using a consistent scheme. Note that the schema allows you to provide more than one ID for a video (see the `other_ids` field described below). This element maps to the “identifier” element in the Dublin Core. 

   - **`id_numbers`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  @@@@@@@@@ add in ReDoc
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_03.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   This element is used to enter document ID others than the archive catalog ID (i.e. other than the `idno` element described above). It can for example be a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), if the DOI was not used in `idno`.
      - **`type`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The type of unique ID.
      - **`value`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The ID <br><br>

   - **`title`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_04.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   The title of the video. This element maps to the element *caption* in VideoObject.

   - **`duration`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_38.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in ISO 8601 date format. This element is a VideoObject element.

   ISO 8601 durations are expressed using the following format, where (n) is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the (n):

   P(n)Y(n)M(n)DT(n)H(n)M(n)S

    Where:
    
       - P is the Period designator and is always placed at the beginning of the duration
       - (n)Y represents the number of years
       - (n)M represents the number of months
       - (n)W represents the number of weeks
       - (n)D represents the number of days
       - T is the Time designator and always precedes the time components
       - (n)H represents the number of hours
       - (n)M represents the number of minutes
       - (n)S represents the number of seconds

   For example, **P1Y2M20DT3H30M8S** represents a duration of one year, two months, twenty days, three hours, thirty minutes, and eight seconds.

   Date and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower-order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, "P23DT23H" and "P4Y" are both acceptable duration representations.

   As *M* can represent both Month and Minutes, the time designator *T* is used. For example, "P1M" is a one-month duration and "PT1M" is a one-minute duration.

   This information on the ISO 8601 was adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) where more detailed information can be found.

   Metadata can be programmatically harvested from external catalogs. The `provenance` group of elements is used to store information on the provenance of harvested metadata, and on alterations that may have been done to the harvested metadata. These elements are NOT part of the IPTC or DCMI metadata standard.
     - **`origin_description`** *[Required ; Not repeatable]* <br>
     The `origin_description` elements are used to describe when and from where metadata have been extracted or harvested.

        - **`base_url`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The URL from where the metadata were harvested.
        - **`identifier`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The unique dataset identifier (`idno` element) in the source catalog. When harvested metadata are re-published in a new catalog, the identifier will likely be changed. The `identifier` element in `provenance` is used to maintain traceability.
        - **`date_stamp`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The datestamp (in UTC date format) of the metadata record in the originating repository (this should correspond to the date the metadata were last updated in the source catalog).
