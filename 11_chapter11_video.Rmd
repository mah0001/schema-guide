The schema we propose to document video files is a combination of elements extracted from the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](https://dublincore.org/) (DCMI) and from the [VideoObject (from schema.org)](https://schema.org/VideoObject) schemas. This schema is very similar to the schema we proposed for audio files (see chapter 10). 

The Dublin Core is a generic and versatile standard, which we also use (in an augmented form) for the documentation of *Documents* (Chapter 4), *Images* (Chapter 9), and *Audio* files (chapter 10). It contains 15 core elements, to which we added a selection of elements from VideoObject. We also included the elements `keywords`, `topics`, `tags`, `provenance` and `additional` that are found in other schemas documented in the Guide. 

The resulting metadata schema is simple, but it contains the elements needed to document the resources and their content in a way that will foster their discoverability in data catalogs. Compliance with the VideoObject elements contributes to search engine optimization, as search engines like Google, Bing and others "reward" metadata published in formats compatible with the schema.org recommendations.

When published in a NADA catalog, the metadata related to video files will appear in a specific tab.

## Augmenting video metadata

Videos typically come with limited metadata. To make them more discoverable, a transcription of the video content can be generated, stored, and indexed in the catalog. This will significantly increase the discoverability of the resource, and offer the possibility to apply semantic searchability on video metadata. Machine learning solutions are available to automatically generate transcriptions at a very low cost. Tools like [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/), [Google Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text?hl=en), or [Microsoft Azure's Speech to Text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/#overview) can reliably convert spoken audio (from audio or video files) to text. The metadata schema we propose includes an element `transcription` that can store transcriptions (and possibly their automatically-generated translations) in the video metadata. Word embedding models and topic models can be applied to the transcriptions to further augment the metadata. 

## Schema description 

The first three elements of the schema (`repositoryid`, `published`, and `overwrite`) are not part of the video metadata. They are parameters used to indicate how the video metadata will be published in a NADA catalog. 

   - **`repositoryid`** identifies the collection in which the metadata will be published. By default, the metadata will be published in the central catalog. To publish them in a collection, the collection must have been previously created in NADA. 

   - **`published`**: Indicates whether the metadata must be made visible to visitors of the catalog. By default, the value is 0 (unpublished). This value must be set to 1 (published) to make the metadata visible.

   - **`overwrite`**: Indicates whether metadata that may have been previously uploaded for the same video can be overwritten. By default, the value is "no". It must be set to "yes" to overwrite existing information. Note that a video will be considered as being the same as a previously uploaded one if the identifier provided in the metadata element `video_description > idno` is the same.


**`metadata_information`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable]*
The metadata information set is used to document the video <u>metadata</u> (not the video itself). This provides information useful for archiving purposes. This set is optional. It is recommended however to enter at least the identification and affiliation of the metadata producer, and the date of creation of the metadata. One reason for this is that metadata can be shared and harvested across catalogs/organizations, so metadata produced by one organization can be found in other data centers. 
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_01.JPG){width=100%}
  <br>
   - **`title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   The title of the video.<br>
   - **`idno`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   A unique identifier for the metadata document (unique in the catalog; ideally also unique globally). This is different from the video unique ID (see `idno` element in section *video_description* below), although it is good practice to generate identifiers that would maintain an easy connection between the metadata `idno` element and the video `idno` found under `video_description` (see below).<br>
   - **`producers`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
   This refers to the producer(s) of the metadata, NOT to the producer(s) of the video. This could for example be the data curator in a data center.<br>
      - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Name of the metadata producer/curator. An alternative to entering the name of the curator (e.g. for privacy protection purpose) is to enter the curator ID (see the element *abbr* below)<br>
      - **`abbr`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Can be used to provide an ID of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
      - **`affiliation`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Affiliation of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
      - **`role`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
      Specific role of the metadata producer/curator.<br>
   - **`production_date`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   Date the metadata (not the table) was produced.<br>
   - **`version`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br> 
   Version of the metadata (not version of the table).<br>

**`video_description`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable]* <br>
The `video_description` section contains all elements that will be used to describe the video and its content. These are the elements that will be indexed and made searchable when published in a data catalog.

   - **`idno`** *[Mandatory, Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_02.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   `idno` is an identification number that is used to uniquely identify a video in a catalog. It will also help users of the data cite the video properly. The best option is to obtain a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/) for the video, as it will ensure that the ID is unique globally. Alternatively, it can be an identifier constructed by an organization using a consistent scheme. Note that the schema allows you to provide more than one identifier for a video (see `identifiers` below). This element maps to the “identifier” element in the Dublin Core. 

   - **`identifiers`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_03.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   This element is used to enter video identifiers other than the `idno` element described above). It can for example be a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Note that the identifier entered in `idno` can be repeated here, allowing to attach a "type" attribute to it.
      - **`type`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The type of unique identifier, e.g., "DOI".
      - **`value`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The identifier. <br><br>

   - **`title`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_04.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   The title of the video. This element maps to the element *caption* in VideoObject. 

   - **`alt_title`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_05.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   An alias for the video title. This element maps to the element *alternateName* in VideoObject.

   - **`description`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_06.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   A brief description of the video, typically about a paragraph long (around 150 to 250 words). This element maps to the element *abstract* in VideoObject.

   - **`genre`** *[Optional ; Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_07.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   The genre of the video, broadcast channel or group. This is a VideoObject element. A controlled vocabulary can be used.

   - **`keywords`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>  
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_08.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   A list of keywords that provide information on the core content of the video. Keywords provide a convenient solution to improve the discoverability of the video, as it allows terms and phrases not found elsewhere in the video metadata to be indexed and to make the video discoverable by text-based search engines. A controlled vocabulary will preferably be used (although not required), such as the [UNESCO Thesaurus](http://vocabularies.unesco.org/browser/thesaurus/en/). The list can combine keywords from multiple controlled vocabularies, and user-defined keywords.  
      - **`name`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The keyword itself.
      - **`vocabulary`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The controlled vocabulary (including version number or date) from which the keyword is extracted, if any.
      - **`uri`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The URL of the controlled vocabulary from which the keyword is extracted, if any.<br><br>

The language refers to the language in which the video is published. This is a block of two elements (at least one must be provided for each language):
      - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The name of the language.
      - **`code`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The code of the language. The use of [ISO 639-2](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) (the alpha-3 code in Codes for the representation of names of languages) is recommended. Numeric codes must be entered as strings. <br><br>

- **`contacts`** *[Optional, Repeatable]* <br>   @@@@@ Do screenshot
Users of the video may need further clarification and information. This section may include the name-affiliation-email-URI of one or multiple contact persons. This block of elements will identify contact persons who can be used as resource persons regarding problems or questions raised by the user community. The URI attribute should be used to indicate a URN or URL for the homepage of the contact individual. The email attribute is used to indicate an email address for the contact individual. It is recommended to avoid putting the actual name of individuals. The information provided here should be valid for the long term. It is therefore preferable to identify contact persons by a title. The same applies for the email field. Ideally, a "generic" email address should be provided. It is easy to configure a mail server in such a way that all messages sent to the generic email address would be automatically forwarded to some staff members.

   - **`duration`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable, String]* <br>
   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_38.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in ISO 8601 format. This element is a VideoObject element. 
   
   ISO 8601 durations are expressed using the following format, where (n) is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that <u>follows</u> the (n). For example: (3)H means 3 hours. 

   **`P(n)Y(n)M(n)DT(n)H(n)M(n)S`**

  Where:<br>
   - P is the **Period designator** and is always placed at the beginning of the duration<br>
     - (n)Y represents the number of years<br>
     - (n)M represents the number of months<br>
     - (n)W represents the number of weeks<br>
     - (n)D represents the number of days<br>
   - T is the **Time designator** and always precedes the time components<br>
     - (n)H represents the number of hours<br>
     - (n)M represents the number of minutes<br>
     - (n)S represents the number of seconds<br>

   For example, **P1Y2M20DT3H30M8S** represents a duration of one year, two months, twenty days, three hours, thirty minutes, and eight seconds.

   Date and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower-order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, "P23DT23H" and "P4Y" are both acceptable duration representations.

   As *M* can represent both Month and Minutes, the time designator *T* is used. For example, "P1M" is a one-month duration and "PT1M" is a one-minute duration.

   This information on the ISO 8601 was adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) where more detailed information can be found.

   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_44.JPG){width=100%}
   <br>
   When a video is published in a catalog containing many other videos, it may be desirable to organize them by album. Albums are collections of videos organized by theme, period, location, or other criteria. One video can belong to more than one album. Albums are "virtual collections". 
      - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>

   <br>
   ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_43.JPG){width=100%}  
   <br>
   Metadata can be programmatically harvested from external catalogs.

These elements are NOT part of the IPTC or DCMI metadata standard.<br>
     - **`origin_description`** *[Required ; Not repeatable]* <br>
     The `origin_description` elements are used to describe when and from where metadata have been extracted or harvested. <br> 
        - **`harvest_date`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The date and time the metadata were harvested, in ISO 8601 format.<br>
        - **`altered`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; Boolean]* <br>
        A boolean variable ("true" or "false"; "true by default) indicating whether the harvested metadata have been modified before being re-published. In many cases, the unique identifier of the study (element `idno` in the Study Description / Title Statement section) will be modified when published in a new catalog.<br>
        - **`base_url`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The URL from where the metadata were harvested.<br>
        - **`identifier`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The unique dataset identifier (`idno` element) in the source catalog. When harvested metadata are re-published in a new catalog, the identifier will likely be changed. The `identifier` element in `provenance` is used to maintain traceability.<br>
        - **`date_stamp`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        The datestamp (in UTC date format) of the metadata record in the originating repository (this should correspond to the date the metadata were last updated in the source catalog).<br>
        - **`metadata_namespace`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
        @@@@@@@ <br>

   - **`tags`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
   As shown in section 1.7 of the Guide, tags, when associated with `tag_groups`, provide a powerful and flexible solution to enable custom facets (filters) in data catalogs. See section 1.7 for an example in R.
  <br>
  ![](./images/ReDoc_videos_44.JPG){width=100%}  
  <br>
    - **`tag`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
    A user-defined tag.
    - **`tag_group`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br><br>
    A user-defined group (optional) to which the tag belongs. Grouping tags allows implementation of controlled facets in data catalogs.

   - **`additional`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable]*<br>
   The `additional` element allows data curators to add their own metadata elements to the schema. All custom elements must be added within the `additional` block; embedding them elsewhere in the schema would cause schema validation to fail.
