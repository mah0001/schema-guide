## Rationale

Documenting, cataloguing and disseminating **data** has the potential to increase the volume and diversity of data analysis. There is also much value in documenting, cataloguing and disseminating **data processing and analysis scripts**. Technological solutions such as GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks or Jupiter Lab facilitate the preservation, versioning, and sharing of code, and enable collaborative work around data analysis. And coding style guides contribute to foster usability, adaptability, and reproducibility of code.[^6] But these solutions do not fully address the issue of cataloguing and discoverability of data processing and analysis programs and scripts. We propose --as a complement to existing solutions-- a metadata schema to document data analysis projects and scripts. The production of structured metadata will contribute not only to discoverability, but also to the reproducibility, replicability, and auditability of data analytics. 

There are multiple reasons to make reproducibility, replicability, and auditability of data analytics a component of a data dissemination system. This will:  

   -	Improve the **quality of research and analytical work**. Public scrutiny enables contestability and independent quality control of the output of research and analytical work; these are strong incentives for additional rigor in data analysis. 
   -	Allow the **re-purposing or expansion of analytical work** by the research community, thereby increasing the relevance, utility and value of both the data and of the analytical work. 
   -	Strengthen the **reputation and credibility** of the analysis. 
   -	Provide students and peers with rich **training materials**.  
   -	In some cases, satisfy a **requirement** imposed by peer reviewed journals or financial sponsors of research activities. For example, the [Data and Policy Code of the American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) (accessed on June 29, 2020), states that *It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented, and access to the data and code is clearly and precisely documented and is non-exclusive to the authors. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to acceptance, information about the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication, as well as information about access to data and programs.* 
   -	Contribute to **assuring the fairness of policy advice and interventions** resulting from data analysis. Data analysis may be used to identify or target the beneficiaries of policies and programs, or may contribute otherwise to the design and implementation of development policies and projects. By doing so, they also contribute to identifying populations to be excluded from these interventions. Errors and biases may be introduced in analysis by accidental or intentional human errors, by the algorithms themselves, or they can result from flaws in the data. The analysis that informs such projects and policies should therefore be made auditable and contestable, i.e. documented and published. 

[^6] To make code usable, good practice in code writing should be applied. This is outside the scope of this guide, but we recommend the following references:
  - [Google style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for multiple programming languages: 
  - [A Guide to Reproducible Code in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf) by the British Ecological Society 


## Motivation for open analytics

[Stodden et al (2013)](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf) [^7] make a useful distinction between five levels of research openness:

1.	**Reviewable research**. The descriptions of the research methods can be independently assessed, and the results judged credible. This includes both traditional peer review and community review and does not imply reproducibility. 
2.	**Replicable research**. Tools are made available that would allow one to duplicate the results of the research, for example by running the authors' code to produce the plots shown in the publication. (Here tools might be limited in scope, e.g., only essential data or executables, and might only be made available to referees or only upon request.)
3.	**Confirmable research**. The main conclusions of the research can be attained independently without the use of software provided by the author. (But using the complete description of algorithms and methodology provided in the publication and any supplementary materials.)
4.	**Auditable research**. Sufficient records (including data and software) have been archived so that the research can be defended later if necessary or differences between independent confirmations resolved. The archive might be private. 
5.	**Open or Reproducible research**. This is auditable research made openly available. This comprised well-documented and fully open code and data that are publicly available that would allow one to (a) fully audit the computational procedure, (b) replicate and also independently reproduce the results of the research, and (c) extend the results or apply the method to new problems.

## Schema description

To make data processing and analysis scripts more discoverable and usable, we propose a metadata schema inspired by the schemas available to document datasets. The proposed schema contains two main blocks of metadata elements: the *document description* intended to document the metadata themselves (the term *document* refers to the file that will contain the metadata), and the *project description* used to document the research or analytical work and the related scripts. We also include in the schema the `tags`, `provenance`, and `additional` elements common to all schemas.

### Document description

**`doc_desc`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable]* <br>
The document description is a description of the metadata file being generated. It is basically the metadata about the metadata file. This block is optional.It is used to document the research project metadata (not the project itself). This information is not needed to document the project; it only provides information, useful for archiving purposes, on the process of generating the project metadata. The information it contains are typically useful to a catalog administrator; they are not useful to the public and do not need to be displayed in the publicly-available catalog interface. This block is optional. It is recommended to enter at least the identification of the metadata producer, her/his affiliation, and the date the metadata were created. One reason for this is that metadata can be shared and harvested across catalogs/organizations, so the metadata produced by one organization can be found in other data centers (complying with standards and schema is precisely intended to facilitate interoperability of catalogs and automated information sharing). Keeping track of who documented a resource is thus useful.

![](./images/ReDoc_scripts_02.JPG){width=100%}

- **`title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
The title of the project. This will usually be the same as the element `title` in the project description section. 

- **`idno`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
A unique identifier for the metadata document.

- **`producers`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable]* <br>
A list of producers <u>of the metadata</u> (who may be but do not have to be the authors of the research project and scripts being documented). These can be persons or organizations. The following four elements are used to identify them and specify their specific role as and if relevant (this block of four elements is repeated for each contributor to the metadata):

   - **`name`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   Name of the person or organization who documented the project. 
   - **`abbr`**: *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   The abbreviation of the organization that is referenced under 'name' above. 
   - **`affiliation`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   Affiliation of the person(s) or organization(s) who documented the project. 
   - **`role`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   This attribute is used to distinguish different stages of involvement in the metadata production process.  <br><br>

- **`prod_date`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br> 
The date the metadata on this project was produced (not distributed or archived), preferably in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD or YYY-MM).

- **`version`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
Documenting a research project is not a trivial exercise. It may happen that, having identified errors or omissions in the metadata or having received suggestions for improvement, a new version of the metadata is produced. This element is used to identify and describe the current version of the metadata. It is good practice to provide a version number, and information on what distinguishes this version from the previous one(s) if relevant. 

  > Example

    ```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
    my_script = list(
      doc_desc = list(
        idno = "META_RP_001", 
        producers = list(
          list(name = "John Doe",
               affiliation = "National Data Center of Popstan")
        ),
        prod_date = "2020-12-27",
        version = "Version 1.0 - Original version of the documentation provided by the author of the project"
      ),
      # ... 
    )
    ```


### Project description 

**`project_desc`** *[Required ; Not repeatable]* <br>
The project description contains the metadata related to the project itself. All efforts should be made to provide as much and as detailed information as possible.

- **`title_statement`** *[Required ; Non repeatable]* <br>
The *title_statement* is a group of five elements, two of them mandatory. 

![](./images/ReDoc_Scripts_03.JPG){width=100%}

   - **`idno`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   A unique identifier to the project. Define and use a consistent scheme to use. Avoid including spaces in the ID.  The ID number of a research project is a unique number that is used to identify a particular project. This ID number is a vital reference. A research project can be the formal cause of a survey, scripts, tables and knowledge products. Do not include spaces in the idno element. Use a system that guarantees uniqueness of the ID (DOI, own reference number).
   - **`title`** *[Required ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
    The title is the official name of the project as it may be stated in reports, papers or other documents. The title will in most cases be identical to the Document Title (see above). The title may correspond to the title of an academic paper, of a project impact evaluation, etc. Pay attention to capitalization in the title.
   - **`sub_title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]*  <br>
   Subtitle is optional and rarely used. A short subtitle for the project. Often the sub title is used to qualify the title or rephrase the title. 
    - **`alternate_title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
    An alternate title of the project. This would be any alternate title that would help discover the research project. In countries with more than one official language, a translation of the title may be provided. Likewise, the translated title may simply be a translation into English from a country's own language.  
   - **`abbreviated_title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   An abbreviated version of the title of the project. Some projects may be referred to using a short name.    
   - **`translated_title`** *[Optional ; Not Repeatable ; String]* <br>
   A translated version of the title (this will be used for example when a catalog documents all entries in English, but wants to preserve the title of a project in its original language when the original language is not English).  

   > Example
  
    ```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
    my_script = list(
      # ... ,
      project_desc = list(
      	title_statement = list(
      		idno = "RR_WB_2020_001",
      		date = "2020",
      		title = "Predicting Food Crises - Econometric Model"
      		),

      ),
      # ...
    )
    ```

- **`abstract`** *[Optional ; Non repeatable ; String]* <br>
The abstract should provide a clear summary of the purposes, objectives and content of the project. An abstract can make reference to the various outputs associated with the research project.

    		# ... ,
    		abstract = "",
    		# ...
      ),
      # ...
    )
    ```


- **`review_board`** *[Optional ; Non repeatable ; String]* <br>
Information on whether and when the project was submitted, reviewed, and approved by an institutional review board (or independent ethics committee, ethical review board (ERB), research ethics board, or equivalent).
![](./images/ReDoc_scripts_05.JPG){width=100%}

- **`output`** *[Optional ; Repeatable]* <br>
This element will describe and reference all substantial/intended products of the research project, which may include publications, reports, websites, datasets, interactive applications, presentations, visualizations, and others. An output may also be referred to as a "deliverable". 
<br>
![](./images/ReDoc_scripts_06.JPG){width=100%}
<br>
The `output` is a repeatable block of seven elements, used to document all output of the research project:
    - **`type`** *[Optional ; Non repeatable]* <br>
    Type of output. The type of output relates to the media which is used to convey or communicate the intended results, findings or conclusions of the research project. This field may be controlled by a controlled vocabulary. The kind on content could be "Working paper", "Database", etc.

Some of this information may also be made visible to users of the data catalog, to inform them of the source of the information they are searching or browsing. The `provenance` block contains metadata elements that are used for this purpose.

Disclaimers limit the responsibility or liability of the publishing organization or researchers associated with the research project. Disclaimers assure that any research in the public domain produced by an organization has limited repercussions to the publishing organization. A disclaimer is intended to prevent liability from any effects occurring as a result of the acts or omissions in the research. 
![](./images/ReDoc_scripts_36.JPG){width=100%} 

- **`confidentiality`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>

      - **`altered`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; Boolean]* <br>
      A boolean variable ("true" or "false"; "true by default) indicating whether the harvested metadata have been modified before being re-published. In many cases, the unique identifier of the study (element `idno` in the Study Description / Title Statement section) will be modified when published in a new catalog.
      - **`base_url`** *[Required ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The URL from where the metadata were harvested.
      - **`identifier`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The unique dataset identifier (`idno` element) in the source catalog. When harvested metadata are re-published in a new catalog, the identifier will likely be changed. The `identifier` element in `provenance` is used to maintain traceability.
      - **`date_stamp`** *[Optional ; Not repeatable ; String]* <br>
      The datestamp (in UTC date format) of the metadata record in the originating repository (this should correspond to the date the metadata were last updated in the source catalog).

				     Original data is in data-PUBLISH/originaldata and is all that 
				     is needed to run the code; all data in data-PUBLISH/codeddata 
				     is created from the coding do files. All results are then 
				     created and saved in output-PUBLISH/tables.
                                       Key Subfolders:
                                       1. code-PUBLISH: This folder contains all relevant code. 
					The master do file is located here ('0Master20190918.do') as well 
					as the two folders that are necessary for the creation of 
					datasets/coding ('coding_matching' folder) and for the 
					analysis/table creation ('analysis' folder). 
					Users should update the directory on the master file to reflect the 
					location of the directory on their computers once downloaded. 
					Following that, all the data and output files needed to replicate 
					the main findings of the paper (Tables 1A-1D, Table 2 and the 4 
					Appendix Tables) will be generated. The sub do files provide 
					specific notes on the variables created where relevant.
                                       2. data-PUBLISH: This folder contains all relevant .dta files. 
					The first folder, 'original data' contains the 'Baseline' folder 
					that has the original baseline survey information. 
				  	Under 'original data' you will also find the 'Others' folder with 
				         the randomization results, the 2008 PPLS data and the PODES 2008 
					village level administrative data. The 'Endline2' folder contains 
					the endline survey information. These datasets have been modified 
					only to mask sensitive information. Finally, the 'codeddata' folder 
					that stores intermediate datasets that are created through the 
					sub 'coding_matching' do files.
                                       3. log-PUBLISH: This folder contains the latest log file. When users 
				        run the master do file, a new log file will automatically be created 
				        and stored here.
                                       4. output-PUBLISH: This folder contains all the tables of the main 
				        paper and appendix. When users run the master do file, these tables 
				        will be automatically overwritten.",
